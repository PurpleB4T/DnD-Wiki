## Mannerisms etc.
### General
- on first glance, he can seem like an innocent young man
- he stares, a lot
	- he keeps eye contact with people :3, just smiling at them 
	- its unclear if he is doing it deliberately or if there is no thoughts behind those eyes
- he acts innocent 
- he doesn't drink, not even material plane alcohol
	- he hides not drinking etc behind "faith" and "purity" even if it is obvious he breaks this in other regards (like virgin but fucks like a rabbit)
- he would even insist on no pain killers or similar things 

### In regards to people
- he hates people talking at him 
- he hates people raising their voices at him, and either gets very defensive or if he is having a bad day he gets meek and quiet
- he is generally mean to most people (with few exceptions) to push people away
- he usually acts like he is better than everyone else
- he has thick skin when it comes to personal insults (minus very specific ones eg. *Cock sucker*, any variant of *used up whore* or *junkie*)
	- there is a massive difference when people insult someone he cares about, he will usually get very angry in response (he has a hard time defending himself versus defending others)
- he actually really cares for people who are desperate, he is also kind to people who sell their bodies (even if he often hides it from people he doesn't trust)
	- in that regard he acts like a typical paladin, granting charity to those most in need (lay on hands to cure diseases, heal etc.)

### Manners of speech (bah)
#### Basics
- naturally used to speak in a similar dialect like Mini, but tried to train it out of himself so now he sounds like the people in his clan
- in regards to swearwords
	- doesn't swear usually (in front of strangers), acting all innocent and all
	- swears more around people he trusts
	- when angry he will absolutely swear like a sailor no matter who he is around (secret turnon for Ares)
- he usually speaks in a higher voice than is natural from him (just bc people take him as less of a thread, its funny), but will switch no his natural voice when intimidating people (again, bc the its funny to him) ((also secret turnon for Ares))
#### Persona (hinged)
> [!hint] Triggered by
> - when around people he doesn't trust as much
> - when he wants to appear a certain way
> - flirting with someone new
- speaks mostly in a polite style of speech
- overall very minimal vernacular
- doesn't really use swear words all that much, acting innocent and even surprised at others using them
	- unless he is angry at something
- usually speaks in a higher voice than is natural for him, with the purpose to disarm people
- self censors a lot of his thoughts
#### Gremlin mode (unhinged)
>[!tip] Triggered by 
> - being comfortable around people
> - high energy
> - tiredness
- still primarily speaks in the dialect of his clan, only sometimes slipping into his childhood dialect (often when speaking with Mini for a while or his mom)
- he is more prone to swearing
	- when angry, he really let's all the swearwords go
- speaks in his more natural voice (deeper to deep)
- slips more into vernacular, his language is less polite and more straight forward
- very energetic style of speech and expressing himself 
#### Angy 
>[!tip] Triggered by 
> - agitation
> - some triggering situations
> - people making assumptions
> - people calling him names when he is not in a generally bad mood
- swears a lot
- very descriptive language used, especially when swearing
- anything that triggers him will make him lash out (like people talking at him)
- kinda mean (very)
- retains his unnatural speaking voice most of the time, like a defence mechanism
- doesn't self censor too much
#### The bad days
>[!tip] Triggered by
> - sometimes out of nowhere, just a bad day
> - triggering situations
> - shitty weather (cloudy, rainy and cold for example)
- doesn't speak a lot generally, usually meek
- when he speaks his language is very straight forward 
- when someone talks at him/ provokes him he just gets meek/ doesn't fight back
- does the bare minimum
	- doesn't dress up nicely, no makeup, depending on how bad the day is he doesn't brush his hair
	- eats the bare minimum
	- usually doesn't go out
#### How to know Eos likes you
| Action/ Mannerism                                                                | Meaning                                                                                                             |

| he makes you food                                                                | good friend                                                                                                         |
| starts annoying you in very specific ways (trying to find things that annoy you) | he is showing affection                                                                                                                    |
--> conclusion: if he shares anything that means he likes you, extra points if he makes it himself

#### 50 Questions (after timeline rewrite 2) 
1. *Are you a morning person or more of a night owl?*
	He tends to wake up early, and while he often ends up in bed late, he tries to get enough rest whenever possible. 
	He used to be a chronic insomniac
2. *What’s the first thing you notice about a person when you meet them?*
   He usually notices wether or not they are of any interest to him (are they fun? Are they a potential flirt or more?)
3. *You see a huge spider in your room. What do you do?*
   If he is alone he usually won't really mind all that much (depending on the size). If Wrobi is around he might kill it to give her a nice snack. If someone besides the people he is close to is in the room, he will scream.
4. *If you could go back and change one decision you made in the past, what would you change?*
   There are a lot of regrets in his life...
   He regrets projecting all of his self loathing on others, thinking they might hate him.
   He wished he had talked to his mother back when he realised he had feelings for Ares, would have spared them a lot of issues. 
   He regrets the way he treated his father when he was a child and teenager, his father turned out to be one of the most supportive people in his life.
   He especially regrets how careless he was with Ares,  he realised how much he hurt him with his actions.
   He regrets the way he treated Minimus, who only ever tried to help him, right from the start. He can't fully blame his substance abuse on himself, because of the circumstances they arose from. Lysium however he blames on Virion since he mistreated him right from the start. 
   
   Raffie. In some ways he still regrets Raffie as a whole, hating how Raffie acted, but he also knows he wasn't the nicest at all. The more he reflected, the more he came to regret how careless he acted with Raffie's feelings. Of course he didn't understand he developed romantic inclinations towards Eos, but he should have known to be less obnoxious about his own feelings towards Ares, since Raffie had expressed multiple times how he hadn't been over Dahlia. Eos also came to regret kicking out Raffie after his rape. Raffie acted immaturely, but if Eos had accepted his help things would have turned out to be better. 
   One regret which he let go of is taking the drink from the guy who ended up raping him. Through talking through it with his brother and other people confirming his words, he eventually stopped blaming himself for his rapes. 
   And then of course, Virion. Virion was his biggest mistake. He should have listened to guy who told him he should stir clear of Virion. It was an obvious warning sign he just ignored since he was so lonely. While he knows he shouldn't blame himself (he really tries), if he could go back and make a different choice, he would always do it. Just that difference would have changed so much, and he would probably be in a better place in life, at least in some ways.
5. *Tell me about your first kiss.*
   Raffie... Eos couldn't have imagined that he'd ever end up kissing a guy, let alone someone he only met half an hour ago. He regrets it as much as he regrets his whole situationship with Raffie, so he is conflicted. 
   His first kiss was still nice, Raffie made him feel comfortable and safe, and he can't say he actually regrets it. But the things that came from it for him... he wishes things could have ended differently, since he genuinely liked Raffie.
6. *Do you give people second chances?*
   Second chances are easily given for a bit of cash :3
   But in all honesty, Eos has a hard time with it. He knows he tends to misinterpret things, but he also has good reason to protect himself. 
7. *Are you a cat person or a dog person?*
   He doesn't mind either way. He isn't too much of a pet person. If Ares however wanted one, he would go along with it and try his best. 
   If he had to pick, he would most likely end up without making a decision. Dogs are great for an active lifestyle, they are also great hunting companions. But Eos knows he might end up stuck at home on a bad day. Which would speak for a cat, since they are more independent. But then again, a dog would force him to leave the house. But cats are little divas, he mashes well with them. They know what they want and when they want it. Overall, the conlusion would end up being that both are too short lived, and he would probably not get over one of them dying after 10-20 years already.
8. *Do you think you’re attractive?*
    It's complicated. 
    According to his ideals for his young self, he is definitely confusing. He is too 'feminine', too flamboyant and definitely cares too much about things 'unbecoming of a man'. However, if young him saw how strong he was, and what he looked like body wise, young him would be jealous.
    His current self would call himself attractive. He knows his features, how to play them up and down. While he still has some discomfort in his own skin that is very hard to shake, he just acts as if he was the hottest person in the room.
9. *What’s your worst habits?*
	~~he doesn't have any of course~~ He has a very hard time trusting people fully (with very few exceptions). He usually will act mean and fake with people that don't belong to his inner circle, all to avoid meaningful relationships.
	He would also call his substance abuse habits as one of his worst habits, but as of age 100, he has been clean for 29 years.
	The last thing to mention here is probably his own self loathing and projecting it onto others. He has gotten a lot better about it, talking to Minimus, his parents and Ares really helped him solidify a better relationship to himself and to others, but he occasionally still ends up expecting the worst in others (also playing into his trust issues).
10. *When was the last time you cried?*
	He doesn't really keep track of it, since it doesn't matter all that much anymore. Over the years, it definitely became less frequent, with him working through his issues. He also only openly cries in front of the people he trusts, mostly Ares and Minimus. He also sometimes cries in front of his parents, but he still has a hard time with that since he still tries to be strong for his mom. 
	The last time he actually cried was probably when he read one of Mini's novels and it either was genuinely touching to him or so bad he had to cry.
11. *Are you a good liar?*
	He doesn't lie of course (actually yes, he is a good liar).
12. *What’s your biggest pet peeve?*
	Other people being hypocrites.
	His sister. 
	Elven superiority complexes. 
13. *Have you ever had your heart broken?*
	Yes, several times actually.
	Not all of them romantic at all, but a broken heart is a broken heart. 
	Even though he has a hard time recognising romantic feelings in himself, and has rarely felt them, the one time he was sure to have them for someone besides Ares, it ended in more than just heartbreak. 
	It was really for good that he ended up spending so much time with Minimus, the most over romantic person ever to tell him that it's ok, and to tell him that he can expect more than what Virion gave him. 
14. *Are you more likely to use your fists or your words in an argument?*
	Whatever stings more :3
15. *What’s something you’re naturally good at?*
	He has always been a fairly charismatic person, so talking to people has always been easy. He generally speaking has an easy time getting what he wants from people, or at least weaselling himself out of things.
16. *What’s something you had to work hard to be good at?*
	 There is many things...
	 He never was the sharpest tool in the shed, so anything to do with intellectual bullshit always came hard to him- he isn't really dumb, but he often just doesn't understand correlations/ the logic of things, he just needs someone to be patient and willing to explain things to him properly.
	 His strength, Eos was always relatively small. When he was young, he was fairly clumsy (pretty much just a normal humanoid kid, but unicorns developed differently) weak and he got sick a lot. Becoming stronger was hard, he ended up too exhausted to get out of bed several times, but he managed.
17. *Can you tell when someone is flirting with you?*
	Of course he can. Anytime someone even shows mild interest Eos is ready to take full advantage of that fact.
18. *Do you think money can buy happiness?*
	See, money itself is completely meaningless, although it is nice to have. But money can get you the stuff that makes you happy, at least in societies that use money. And Eos definitely prefers using money to trade than his body. 
19. *Do you believe in destiny?*
	He doesn't really. Destiny is a stupid concept, he was never destined to be who he is today. 
	The only times he' believes' in destiny is when he is wrapping a dude around his finger, playing the whole stick of "destiny brought us together".
20. *Are you a good cook?*
	A real man can provide of course... but he has a natural talent to fuck up on new recipes. 
	His food is decent, nothing out of the ordinary, but it fulfils the requirements of being nourishing and good for the body. 
21. *What do you think happens after you die?*
	He doesn't really care all that much anymore. Can't be worse than anything he went through right? Also if he goes to hell everyone he loves will also be there so whats the big deal?
22. *Did you have to grow up fast?*
	In a way, yes. The responsibility he had to take on for his existence took a lot of him. 
	He also tried to help out his mom as much as possible, since their situation was rather unstable. 
23. *Who do you look up to?*
	 He thinks (and always thought) Ares is really cool. When he was young he thought he was jealous, but it turned out he just really admired him (and had a crush lmao). Ares was strong, mentally and physically, super smart (and actually he was nice to him, explaining things again and again until Eos got things) and he always knew so much. Ares also really cares about people, which Eos admires. (even the most mundane shit Ares does is cool to Eos).
	 He also greatly admires his mother. She did so much for him, always supporting him, trying her best to make him comfortable, watching out for him. He genuinely loves her and admires her ability to persevere, where he thought he wouldn't be able to.
	 He also admires his brother. While he hated him in his younger years, thinking of him as a naive dumbass and hating how much he immediately got about Eos, he came to really appreciate him. He can't help but admire his insistence, his drive to create and his kindness. 
24. *When you go to a tavern, what do you order?*
	Either some nice tea, or expensive fruit juice (if offered) some lavish, expensive food and then he will try to wrap the next best guy around his fingers and make him pay for it. 
25. *What do you like most about yourself?*
	He really likes his hair. He takes a lot of time taking care of it, styling it etc. 
26. *What do you like least about yourself?*
	Of course he doesn't hate anything about himself...
	Actually, his goatee. It was one of those things that he wanted when he was young but could never grow. But then, out of nowhere, when he was in his late 50s, a goatee began sprouting on his chin. Now it's more of a hassle, having to shave it off daily. He doesn't hate it as much anymore as he used to, since Ares seems to think it's cute. 
	His pink rings used to cause him a lot of distress. It was a constant reminder of his addiction and the issues that came along with it. He hated just how different he looked, his old self now gone forever. But as years passed, and he felt more and more like himself again, he came to hate them less and less.
27. *Do you want kids someday?*
	If there is one thing he is aware of, its that he is definitely not the best with kids, so he knows he probably shouldn't have any, at least not in the near future. 
	His feelings to kids are also complex. On one hand, he thinks they are terrible assholes but on the other hand, he knows how vulnerable and even sweet they can be. So he really respects Ares for his being good with kids. 
	If Ares really wanted kids, he might consider it, but since Ares is fine on that department, Eos just stays the way he is. 
28. *Are you a planner, or more spontaneous?*
	He tried to make plans... he failed. He is more spontaneous through and through. 
29. *Can you keep a secret?*
	He can... if he wants to. He will absolutely abuse his knowledge of secrets though, if it gives him an advantage in any way. 
	Also, Ares is a massive gossip, so whenever Eos finds out anything of interest (usually means anything), he will let Ares know.
30. *Do you like being the centre of attention?*
	He is an attention whore. 
31. *If you knew you were going to die tomorrow, what would you do today?*
	~~Probably Fuck~~ Spend quality time with Ares ~~and fuck~~. 
	Also contact his family, talk to them and if he can, spend time with them.
1. *Do you enjoy getting all dressed up for a special occasion?*
	He has a collection of attires for all sorts of events. Parties, gatherings, dinners, cult sermons etc. etc. 
33. *Where do you feel safe?*
	He has always felt safe around Ares. He always understood him. When Ares' returned, Eos also felt safe around him, as Ares never saw him when he was, well, not sober. Of course he knew of it thanks to the messages he sent, but generally, it was a great reassurance that there is at least one person who knew him before and remembers him by that. Ares' acceptance of Eos after the fact also helped a lot. In general, Ares is kind and loving, so Eos feels incredibly safe around him.
	Minimus, being around him makes him very comfortable. Mini never left him, never stopped trying to reach out and even at his worst, never saw him as unworthy. Mini never judged him and only watched out for him, the first person able to get through to him. 
	After talking to his parents again and working through some issues, he actually feels really safe around them again. His father was kind and patient, a fact he greatly appreciates.
34. *Do you love or hate being alone?*
	He has a very complicated relationship with being on his own. 
	His loneliness always spoke to him being different, not fitting in. When his thoughts caught up with him, he tried to never be alone, as to not give into temptation. This need to be with people continued for a while, as he slid right into negative habits. He developed a very negative relationship with sex post Raffie, using it and alcohol to drown out his lack of meaningful relationships. Even though it was hard to be with people, he couldn't not be with them. This issue only got worse in his 40s. 
	After Mini reached out to him, being alone once again became giving into his cravings. So he was terrified of it.
	The older he got, the easier it became for him to be alone again, as he became secure in his own well being and with his relationships.
35. *What’s the last nightmare you remember having?*
    He barely remembers his dreams, but when he does they are usually bad. Often its memories of back then, specific ones or his brain mixing them together.  
36. *Do you admit to mistakes when you make them?*
    No... (with some exceptions, like to Ares, or to Minimus)
37. *Do you want to grow up to be like your parents?*
    Ewww, no. (He hates it when he has to put on his reading glasses and a bit of his dad comes through)
38. *How do you deal with being sick? Are you stoic, or super whiny?*
    He used to get sick a lot, but tried to be stoic about it, since he didn't wanna come of as weak.
    When he started running from his thoughts he would actually power through it. So he probably had like week long exhaustion flu episodes, where he would just pass out.
    Now he tries his best to rest when he feels off, even though he doesn't get ill, when he eats something wrong or has a bad day, he will spend some time reading books or talking to Ares to distract himself. His resting usually doesn't last longer than a day or else he'll feel restless.
39. *What did your parents expect from you when you were born?*
     Nothing much. His dad didn't even know he existed up until he was like 10 or something and his mom just was more surprised than anything (since like, you know, a satyr baby is probs smaller than a fucking unicorn foal) so it caught her off guard. 
40. *Do you have a strong sense of style?*
    Yes.
41. *Would you rather camp outdoors or stay the night in an inn?*
     Both good and have their advantages. 
42. *Is there a food that most people like that you absolutely hate?*
    Bread... Wrobi understood why he got issues on anything like material plane bread and cookies. Minimus introduced him to them, and he absolutely loved all sorts of sweets. But most things would cause him intense issues, which wasn't fun in the slightest. But Wrobi understood within a few instances what was wrong. Material plane flour is made from different crops, so he seems to react to typical material plane flour. So when they replaced that with different ingredients akin to things more common in the feywild he was fine. He still doesn't like bread, since it was what originally first caused him issues. 
43. *Are you more of a hoarder or a minimalist?*
    Ares often gives him shit random kids made for him, so now (bc he can't throw that shit away right?) has an extra shack/tree to keep all the random shit he gets. So, by definition he a hoarder by proxy. 
44. *Are you superstitious?*
    Used to be, but the consequences he was told would happen never came true. (Hah, people told him he would get sick from premarital sex and look at that, immune to disease after becoming sexually active)
    At some point he "realised" those superstitions were correct, and that what he went through was his personal hell, his punishment. Minimus however made him realise he didn't deserve any of it, and that he deserves to be better.
    But genuinely, he used to be but most things turned out to be weird shit to scare people and make them "behave".
45. *Are you the kind of person who remembers people’s birthdays and pets’ names and stuff?*
    He tried really hard to memorise unicorn scripture in his childhood. He still has it stuck in his head to this day. When he joined the satyr clan, he also was introduced to satyr clan memorisation. So, he kinda learned to remember everything. 
46. *What do you do to feel better when you’re sad?*
   He usually ends up talking to Ares and Minimus, since both of them make him feel comfortable and understood. 
   Nowadays, one way is also to fuck, mostly with Ares, since he developed an actually mostly positive relationship with sex.
47. *Is it hard for you to trust someone?*
	It is very hard. He could count the people he trusts on one hand, with him only requiring his second hand recently. 
48. *Are you susceptible to peer pressure?*
    ~~He is the peer pressure~~ Welp... unicorns and all... so yeah... used to be, especially after the second incident. He did a lot of things people told him to do, even if he didn't want to do it, just so he could get his hands on what he wanted. He garnered a terrible reputation for it too, that haunted him for many years. Virion was no exception, and once he got hooked on Lysium this was only worse. Lysium made him extremely suggestive, so he was barely himself anymore. Now he just doesn't trust people anymore... thats better right?
49. *If you decided to stop adventuring and settle down, what kind of job would you take?*
    ~~Cult leader~~. He would probably just keep doing what he wants to do, since satyr society doesn't really have jobs in the traditional sense. He might end up helping out the [[1. Eranvale Campaign/Locations/Fey Wild/Eos Clan/Chrysanthy Clan\|Chrysanthy Clan]] like he used to when he was young, healing etc. 
50. *As a kid, what did you want to be when you grew up?*
      welp, christian indoctrination and all : D 
    so a good ~~christian~~ unicorn

## Relationships
### Safe People
[[03. Someshots/Saving Wenzin/Player Characters/Minimus Braveheart of Heartwood\|Minimus]]; he is the first person he tells things (minus Ares' via the stone), Mini becomes an emotional anchor for him in many ways
[[05. Eos/People/Wrobi\|Wrobi]]; similar to Minimus
[[05. Eos/People/Ares Philamon of Maplevine\|Ares]]; Eos takes a bit to truly feel at ease around him, a lot of his anger not manifesting is because he is just exhausted, by the time he has the energy to be angry, it is mostly replaced by mutual understanding and empathy for Ares
[[05. Eos/People/Estar Antares of the Glies Congregation\|Estar]]; 
[[05. Eos/People/Maro of Chrysanthy\|Maro]]

### Ares
- get together some time after reunion
- Eos feels mostly safe around him --> as time goes by it goes very much uphill to a point where he can trust him completely 
	- during this time of schroedinger's dating
		- Ares gives Eos trinkets and gifts on the daily
		- Has a Love shack corner set up for Eos (with curtain for privacy (he can also stay there when ares isn't there))
		- Will take Eos on 'dates' aka just fun trips and things they enjoyed doing before
		- Will also tell Eos about his elaborate plans to topple a variety of ruling society in Material Plane and Faewild alike (Underdark??)
		- Maybe eventually he will even feel comfortable enough to ask Eos to spar again (the thing that made shit go downhill...)
		- (Secretely, Ares is setting things in motion to take down Virion's family)
		- 
- One day, Ares does something really stupidly romantic (again), like recreating a shared special memory (maybe the day Eos kicked Milo in the butt they had a celebratory picknick at a cool spot, he found the exact spot again)
	- Eos then proceeds to ask if the previous things ares did (recently and during their teens) were romantic gestures (since he now has more context and experience and he knows this isnt just friendship)
		- Ares might not have realized back in his teens that this was a bit out of the ordinary for a friendship (also things his mom may have told him then, when she explained that he seemed to be coming onto Eos)
		- Maybe even now, he didn't really consciously try to make it romantic and upon Eos asking, is probably anxious that he put him on the spot/pressured him
	- E (thinking of what Mini would tell him to say): "...." [self conscious] "You still like me?"
	  [before Ares can say anything] "I am not uncomfortable by that! IF you do! Or if you don't."
	- A [under his breath]: "I haven't gotten over you in 30 years, I'm not gonna get over you now..."
	- E: "Even after the way I treated you?"
	- A: "That should be my line."
	- E: "Even after finding out who I am?"
	- A: "So far I found nothing I didn't like."
	- E: "Even if I am disgusting?"
	- A: "Even if you are- you're not disgusting!!"
	- E: "I'm not?"
	- A: "Of course not- what exactly do you see as disgusting?"
	- E: ".... I don't know...."
	- "Well, just so you know, anything the Unicorns have told you is complete crap, you should be allowed to love yourself and live your life in peace and [goes off on a rant]"
	- Eos proceeds to watch him for the next 3 mins of rant thinking before going fuck it
	- Eos takes Ares' hand
	- Ares is undeterred and keeps ranting ("...And anyway, the societal structures of unicorn congregations are simply...")
	- Eos makes a |:< face
	- Eos puts his hand on Ares' neck and pulls him down
	- Da wird Ares *ganz* still
	- :< *stare* from Eos
	- Eos asks if its ok to kiss him
	- Ares blushes like the communist manifesto and nods
	- it happens (the kithy!!)
	- Ares is pretty terrible at it (teeth, and also he forgot to breathe so he eventually has to pull away with a gasp)! 
	- E: "Are you okay?"
	- A: ".....I... haven't done this a lot. Sorry if I'm.. bad at it."
	- E: "You... you haven't? I didn't think you were that type."
	- A: "...type?"
	- E: "You know, the people who just... you know?"
	- A (genuinely confused): "I really don't."
	- Eos looks at him
	- Ares looks at him
	- A: "Is this a sex thing?"
	- E: "How many times did you share a kiss with someone?"
	- A: ".....Like.... twice?"
	- E: :O
	- A: "I'm.... sure I'll get better with practice.... Sorry to disappoint."
	- E: "I... what? You talk as if you never did anything?? But I thought you were? what"
	- <span class="Ares">A: "I don't know, I guess I'm not a proper satyr but I'm just not into anyone but you...?'"</span>
	- E: "But I thought you were at a gathering? I heard people talk? "
	- A (seems to think really hard): "........you mean (nameof gathering)?? Before I left?"
	- E: "Yeah..."
	- A: "That was my first time in the adult section. I didn't know it got so... busy."
	- E (bemused): "What did you expect then?"
	- A: "I don't know, more talking?"
	- E (kinda chuckling before suddenly going serious): "So you... never did anything?"
	- A (blushing, looking away): "............is that a problem?"
	- E: ".... no. I just... didn't expect that." (to himself "that explains the smell")
	- A (shy): "...."
	- E: "So are you even into... fucking? No judgement at all!"
	- A (shy): "If it's you."
	- E: "Hmh"
	- A: "Aand, if that's something you even want of course!"
	- E (now having lost all his inhibitions thanks to Ares having seen all his worst sides and somehow still being ok with him): "Yeah, you have no idea what my hormonal brain came up with when I was 17. And I can't lie, when you opened the doors of the stupid fucking love shack when I came to apologise and I just had a pair of accentuated tits on eye height I think I short circuited and that evening... You know what, yeah I can say this you heard worse from me, I made Raffie fuck me against the wall and all I could think of is you. There." (not even red, just kinda nonchalant )
	- A (squats down on the floor, face in hands (absolutely hiding two boners now)): "Good gods, Eos."
	- E: "Its not my fault you decided to get tattoos which complement your body. Like, what was I supposed to think, huh?"
	- A: "......"
	- E: "And then you come back, even broader. Like what did they feed you in the material plane? This is so unfair. I don't know how to deal with all my emotions and then second day I see you again I have to realise that I really just want to squish your ass. You know, here I am, thinking I am not ready for anything but my libido returns to me full force and I can't do anything because I'm just... idk. Not sure of anything? And then I'm never alone and I'm horny this entire fucking time I swear to god. .... Why are you on the floor?"
	- A: ".............."
	- A (muffled): "You wanna know the reason I got buff in the first place?"
	- E: "Kinda."
	- A (still muffled): "Cause training was the only thing that kept me from constantly jerking off to you."
	- E (very much bemused): "You serious?"
	- A: "I felt so bad about it.... Still do."
	- E (very very amused): "Haha, it's almost like we mind fucked each other then."
	- A (Looks up through hands): "Huh?"
	- E: "As I said, 17 year old me was loosing it over you. You were just on top of me all of the sudden and my mind filled in all the blanks and ooooh boy. I felt like I was loosing my mind, suddenly such sinful thoughts, about you no less. My best friend. Kinda funny now, that that was my only problem. Like, you did all sorts of fun things to me. And no matter what I did these thoughts always came up. Everywhere, especially around you.":3
	- A (swallows, incredibly red): "......"
	- A: "..Can we try... kissing again?"
	- E: "Sure" (very much entertained by this entire thing, but like, non malicious. He is, however not getting down to Ares)
	- A (looks pained, standing up slowly (hands in front of his crotch)): "...." looks at Eos expectantly
	- E (looks at his hands, 0.0): ".... heh"
	- Ares: (kisses eos on the cheek super fast)
	- E: "Wowie, damn. You are terrible at this" (genuine smile)
	- A (takes a step closer, grabs Eos back of the head gently, waiting for protest)
	- Eos kisses him properly
	- Ares is a fast learner :)
	- (still has one hand on his crotch, mentally cursing the fact that he doesn't like pants)
	- [After a lot of heated kissing] A: "..........Imma go cool down."
	- E: :3 "Have fun." :3
	- A: "Oh, you're coming with me" - throws Eos in the river.
	- Eos ein nasser pudel im fluss *suprised Pikachu face*: "Bitch!"
	- A: :P (walks off)
	- Eos gets out, sits down, has a laugh (and plots his revenge)

		- Eos just stares at him (⊙︿⊙ ✿)
		- Scene End- 
- After 12 years, Estar asks Eos if they ever considered hand fasting, 
	- Eos nonchalant says no
		- she asks if they ever talked about it
		- Eos is like huh... no
		- Eos makes a mental note, but thinks it wouldn't be a big deal since he is so against institutions or whatever
	- Eos comes home, with some of his dad's cooking, gives Ares some and then just asks if akin of "I know you are probably not a fan of those things..."
		- Ares will ask if Eos means like, the two of them and when confirmed, will start crying all of a sudden
		- E (very confused): "... Why are you crying?"
		- A (choked up): "I'm Sorry..." 
		- E (Eos offers him a hug): "I don't know why you are apologising. Do you not want to do this?"
		- A (squishes Eos, still crying): "I want to!"
		- A: Continues crying for a while
		- E (after a while of patta patta, thinking about things): "Is this important to you?"
		- A: "I didn't think it was, but yeah. It is."
		- E: "I'm sorry I never realised or thought of it. I don't know, I just never thought of it as a possibility."
		- A (with wonderfully puffy eyes): "It's okay."
		- E: "You look like a goldfish."
		- A: "A goldfish you'd have a clan with?"
		- E (chuckling): "Yeah. The only goldfish I'd have a clan with."
		- Ares squeezes Eos really hard and starts crying again
		- wohee (in the future Eos will aks, and upon finding out the issue was Ares not feeling special to Eos he will give him a long as speech about how special he is. And that he is sorry he is not good with expressing his romantic feelings but that he will try. And he proceeds to be very vocal about every romantic gesture for the next year.)
## History
Refer to [[05. Eos/Eos History/Eos History\|Eos History]]
## Mental Health
### General
- he suffers from depression 
	- he used to suffer from severe depression 
	- mostly good at dealing with symptoms of it, has healthy coping mechanisms 
- CPTSD and RTS
	- he has learned how to deal with his traumas
	- he established a safety net for himself (mostly family and Ares)
- he still has a hard time trusting people
	- to this day, one of the only ways to connect to people is casual sex 
- he still has a hard time emotionally regulating
- hides insecurities behind a veil of confidence
### Hyper sexuality
- while he always had a high sex drive, there is a clear difference between pre and post sexual trauma him
	- especially between ages 22-50 there were barely any days where he didn't have sex with some random person
	- on one hand he thought he wasn't allowed to ever stop and on the other it was a way for him to pretend that he is fine and in control
- he used to be a lot less healthy about his sexual engagement with people, but post "therapy" (and Ares) he learned that his boundaries are worth respecting
- in ways, he also deals with his trust issues through sex (post Ares)
	- to him sex is one of the ways to connect to people, to see what they are like (intimacy without needing the full trust)
	- it also used to be the only way for him to experience any sort of physical intimacy and to pretend he isn't lonely
	- this used to be a lot more prevalent, as previously stated, but his security in his familiar, platonic and romantic relationships his need for intimacy through casual sex decreased
		--> it's still a thing he does, but it's more out of choice than because he needs to
- the only dampers on this were in part Lysium and subsequently becoming sober
	- Lysium replaced all need for intimacy for him, he just did it because either Virion wanted to or because he traded for Lysium
	- when he got sober he had to confront his traumas since he couldn't drown them out anymore, so he had a hard time trusting anyone enough to have sex with them
		--> he even took a while for him to be comfortable enough around Ares again to be sexually intimate
		--> it took him around 2 years with Ares before he would be able to trust anyone else enough
### Phobias and fears
- as a result of his assault, he developed certain phobias and fears:
	- post being sober he could no longer hide his fear of crowds, since he used substances to help him cope with it before 
	- he developed a phobia to the characteristics of his rapist(s), which also led to him fearing his father, this has been mostly resolved
	- while he would never admit to it, he was afraid of elves (especially sun elves) for a long while, nowadays he mostly reacts with staged anger (to mask his own anxieties, even if they have gotten a lot better)
	- he used to not be able to be left alone once he was clean, since he was terrified of being abandoned again and relapsing
		- nowadays he is a lot more secure in being alone/ being apart from friends and family but he still prefers not being alone
### Coping mechanisms
- he writes and talks to Mini on the regular
- he keeps a journal of very unorganised thoughts and fears (Ares is the only one who ever gets to see it)
- he tries his hardest to voice any of his fears, so others and himself can reassure him about them/ resolve them
- support network primarily consisting of his family 
- he tries to be prepared for anything triggering
	- certain places (his old home), anniversaries(birthday, the period before his birthday, the day of his first rape) certain people (Virion especially, but also the first guy)
	- *his birthday:*
		- his birthday is associated with a lot of negativity, he usually tries to only see the positives with it (like the fact people care about him, the fact that he is still here etc.) but he still finds himself in a bad mood around that time
- flashbacks: 
	- grounds himself using reality, reminding himself how old he is, where he is etc. 
	- sings lullabies his mother used to sing to him (when he was a child and when he returned to the feywild as an adult)
- self loathing
	- while he did get a lot better about his self loathing, he still struggles with it especially when he makes mistakes
	- he usually copes by pretending to be better than everyone else and not letting other people dictate how he should act
- trying new hobbies 
	- he really tries to find something to pass the time and to make him feel better so he tries a lot of shit
	- he sucks at most things though
	- ultimately, he comes to the conclusion that he somewhat enjoys *basic cooking and baking* (even if everything new he tries fails miserably) and working his creative bone through things like art therapy (imagine shitty shaky drawings with crayons but he is trying and the colours look good), makeup, clothing and beta reading Mini's novels
- coping with addiction
	- for the mental part he uses a lot of distraction methods, replacing the negative coping mechanisms with productive ones
	- for the physical, things are more complicated
		- eventually, possibly with the help of Arti and Maro some sort of medicine that helps through the first few years
			- (possible ideas something like a weed derivative with other shit since it does help with anxieties lmao)
		- he also copes by replacing his habits with different ones:
			- drinking: he drinks a lot of teas (mainly fruit teas but anything goes really + fruit and veggie juices, also its all sweetened to hell and back bc he discovered he likes sweets)
			--> fruit teas and juices often evoke the same feeling as cocktails and other shit, so it's also easy to mask in social situations with peer pressure to drink something
			- sweet foods: 
				- he discovers he loves sweet foods, anything from fresh and dried fruits to pastries and candies
				- this also helps him develop a healthy relationship with food, learning it's okay to enjoy foods (not being able to enjoy food partially bc of religion, partially bc of food avoidance thanks to being triggered)

### Guilt
- Religious Trauma
	- a lot of his early mental issues were results of his religious upbringing 
	- his religious trauma still affects him to this day
	- to this day he still knows the entirety of the unicorn doctrine by heart
	- he was extremely conflicted about his own sexuality for the longest time 
	- he still feels guilt every now and again for enjoying things
	- he also believed his issued aren't bad enough/ that others have it much worse
		- in addition, he also thought his traumas were punishment for sinning
	- nowadays he is less affected directly, around his 60s he harboured a lot of rage against gods, and to this day he is mostly cynical about faith in gods
- Sexual Assault
	- he used to feel immense guilt for his sexual assaults
	- he is still vulnerable to people blaming him on his own emotional distress
- relationships (mainly Virion)
	- guilt of hurting people (this got better over time having proper relationships)

### Resulting Kinks
- Religion related
	- corruption
	- chastity
	- degredation
	- praise
	- humiliation
	- group sex
	- disciplining 
	- roleplay
	- public/ risky places
	- orgasm denial
	- cuckhold
	-  clothes related to religion
		- anything to with loss of purity
		- good and evil
		- demons/ hell
- reclaiming of his own sexuality
	- sub/ dom dynamics (initially very mild since his trauma was related, eventually he becomes more comfortable with them again) (agan, present before but now stronger)
	- loss of control (only with people he trusts)
	- giving up control (only with people he trusts)
	- bondage and restraints
	- oral fixation
		- face fucking (only in very specific context and only with people he trusts)
	- group sex
	- glory hole
	- rough sex
-
