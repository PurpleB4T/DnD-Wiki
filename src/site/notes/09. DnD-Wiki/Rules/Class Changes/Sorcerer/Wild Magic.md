[[09. DnD-Wiki/Rules/Class Changes/Sorcerer/Sorcerer\|Back to Sorcerer]]

**Your innate magic comes from the wild forces of chaos that underlie the order of creation. You might have endured exposure to some form of raw magic, perhaps through a planar portal leading to Limbo, the Elemental Planes, or the mysterious Far Realm. Perhaps you were blessed by a powerful fey creature or marked by a demon. Or your magic could be a fluke of your birth, with no apparent cause or reason. However it came to be, this chaotic magic churns within you, waiting for any outlet.**

* **Wild Magic:** Added
* **Wild Magic Surge:** Rewritten
* **Chaotic Spell:** Added
* **Tides of Chaos:** Unchanged
* **Bend Luck** Improved
* **Controlled Chaos:** Unchanged
* **Spell Bombardment:** Unchanged

### Wild Magic
*(Improved 1st level "Sorcerous Origins" feature)*

You learn additional spells when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown on the Wild Magic Spells table. Each of these spells counts as a sorcerer spell for you, but it doesn't count against the number of sorcerer spells you know. Whenever you gain a sorcerer level, you can replace one spell you gained from this feature with another spell of the same level. The new spell must be an enchantment or transmutation spell from the sorcerer, warlock or wizard spell list.

##### Wild Magic Spells
| Sorcerer Level  | Spells |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1st  | ***Chaos Bolt, Faerie Fire*** |
|  3rd  | ***Mirror Image, Enlarge/reduce*** |
|  5th  | ***Blink, Haste*** |
|  7th  | ***Confusion, Polymorph*** |
|  9th  | ***Animate Objects, Wall of Force*** |

### Wild Magic Surge
*(Variant 1st level feature)*

Starting when you choose this origin at 1st level, your spellcasting can unleash surges of untamed magic. 

Immediately after you cast a sorcerer spell of 1st level or higher, you roll a d20. If you roll a number equal to or below your wild magic threshold, which starts at 1, roll on the Wild Magic Surge table to create a random magical effect. 

Each time you roll and don't get a Wild Magic Surge, the threshold number increases by 1. Your wild magic threshold resets to 1 after a Wild Magic Surge activates or you finish a short or long rest. A Wild Magic Surge can only happen once per turn.

If a Wild Magic effect is a spell, it's too wild to be affected by Metamagic. If it normally requires concentration, it doesn't require concentration in this case; the spell lasts for its full duration.

### Tides of Chaos
*(1st level feature)*
Starting at 1st level, you can manipulate the forces of chance and chaos to gain advantage on one attack roll, ability check, or saving throw. Once you do so, you must finish a long rest before you can use this feature again.

Any time before you regain the use of this feature, the DM can have you roll on the Wild Magic Surge table immediately after you cast a sorcerer spell of 1st level or higher. You then regain the use of this feature.

### Chaotic Spell
*(Added 2nd level feature)*
When you cast a spell of 1st level or higher, you may spend between 1-3 sorcery points and immediately roll on the Wild Magic Surge table that many times.

### Bend Luck
*(Re-written 6th level feature)*

Starting at 6th level, you have the ability to twist fate using your wild magic. When another creature you can see makes an attack roll, an ability check, or a saving throw, you can use your reaction to roll **1d6** and apply the number rolled as a bonus or penalty (your choice) to the creature's roll. You can do so after the creature rolls but before any effects of the roll occur.

You can use this feature **a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus**, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

### Controlled Chaos
*(14th level feature)*

At 14th level, you gain a modicum of control over the surges of your wild magic. Whenever you roll on the Wild Magic Surge table, you can roll twice and use either number.

#### Spell Bombardment
*(18th level feature)*

*You gain resistance to force damage*
Beginning at 18th level, the harmful energy of your spells intensifies. When you roll damage for a spell and roll the highest number possible on any of the dice, choose one of those dice, roll it again and add that roll to the damage. You can use the feature only once per turn.
