### Spellcasting
*(Improved 1st level feature)*

An event in your past, or in the life of a parent or ancestor, left an indelible mark on you, infusing you with arcane magic. This font of magic, whatever its origin, fuels your spells.

#### Cantrips
At 1st level, you know four cantrips of your choice from the [sorcerer spell list](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spells:sorcerer). You learn additional sorcerer cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Sorcerer table.

#### Spell Slots
The Sorcerer table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your sorcerer spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these sorcerer spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.

For example, if you know the 1st-level spell _[burning hands](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:burning-hands)_ and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast _[burning hands](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:burning-hands)_ using either slot.

#### Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher
You know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the sorcerer spell list.

The Spells Known column of the Sorcerer table shows when you learn more sorcerer spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 3rd level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.

Additionally, **whenever you finish a long rest** or gain a level in this class, you can choose up to three of the sorcerer spells you know and replace it with another spell from the sorcerer spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

#### Spellcasting Ability
Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your sorcerer spells, since the power of your magic relies on your ability to project your will into the world. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a sorcerer spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

**Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier
**Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier

#### Spellcasting Focus
You are your own spell casting focus. You can still use a different focus if you chose to do so.

#### Spell Catalyst 
*(Added 2nd level feature)*

At 2nd level, as your control over your innate magic grows, you can function as an arcane focus. You can allow a creature touching you to use you as an arcane focus for spells they cast until the end of your next turn.

When a creature casts a spell while using you as an arcane focus, you can use your reaction and spend 2 sorcery points to influence the spell in one of the following ways. You must use this reaction before the spell's effects activate.
-   Guided Spell. You add half your proficiency bonus (rounded down) to the attack or damage roll of the spell.
-   Strengthened Spell. You add half your proficiency bonus (rounded down) to the spell save DC or damage roll of the spell.

At 6th level, you gain the ability to directly shape the magical energies around you. When a creature casts a spell while using you as an arcane focus, you can use your reaction to affect the spell with a metamagic you know, spending sorcery points as per normal.

### Font of Magic
*(2nd level feature)*

At 2nd level, you tap into a deep wellspring of magic within yourself. This wellspring is represented by sorcery points, which allow you to create a variety of magical effects.

* **Sorcery Points.** You have a **number sorcery points equal to your Sorcerer Level + your Charisma modifier + your Proficiency Bonus**, gaining more as you reach higher levels. 
For an example: you're a 5th level sorcerer with a Charisma Ability Score of 18, you would have a maximum of 12 sorcery points (5 Sorcerer Level + 3 Proficiency Bonus + 4 Charisma Modifier).
You **regain a number of sorcery points equal to your Proficiency Bonus whenever you finish a short rest**, and you regain all expended sorcery points when you finish a long rest
* **Flexible Casting.** You can use your sorcery points to gain additional spell slots, or sacrifice spell slots to gain additional sorcery points. You learn other ways to use your sorcery points as you reach higher levels.
    *   **Creating Spell Slots.** You can transform unexpended sorcery points into one spell slot as a free action on your turn. The Creating Spell Slots table shows the cost of creating a spell slot of a given level. You can create spell slots no higher in level than 5th. Any spell slot you create with this feature vanishes when you finish a long rest.
    * **Converting a Spell Slot to Sorcery Points.** As a free action on your turn, you can expend one spell slot and gain a number of sorcery points equal to the slot's level.
 
| Spell Slot Level	| Sorcery Point Cost |
| :---: | :---: |
| 1st |	2 |
| 2nd |	3 |
| 3rd |	5 |
| 4th | 6 |
| 5th |	7 |

* **Careful Spell.** When you cast a spell that forces other creatures to make a saving throw, you can protect some of those creatures from the spell's full force.

A chosen creature automatically succeeds on its saving throw against the spell.
* **Distant Spell.** When you cast a spell that has a range of 5 feet or greater, you can spend 1 sorcery point to double the range of the spell.

* **Extended Spell.** (rewritten)

    *  When you cast a spell that has a duration of 10 minutes, you can spend 2 sorcery points to change the duration to 1 hour.
    *  When you cast a spell that has a duration of 1 hour, you can spend 2 sorcery points to change the duration to 8 hours.

* **Seeking Spell.** If you make an attack roll for a spell and miss, you can spend 2 sorcerer points to reroll the d20, and you must use the new roll.

* **Twinned Spell.** When you cast a spell that targets only one creature and doesn't have a range of self, you can spend a number of sorcery points equal to the spell's level to target a second creature in range with the same spell (1 sorcery point if the spell is a cantrip). To be eligible, a spell must be incapable of targeting more than one creature at the spell's current level. For example, magic missile and scorching ray aren't eligible, but ray of frost and chromatic orb are.
* **Measured Spell.** When you reduce a creature to 0 hit points with a spell, you can spend 1 sorcery point to knock the creature out, rendering it unconscious, rather than deal a killing blow.
* **Contingent Spell.** When you cast a spell of 5th level or lower, you may spend 2 sorcery points to delay the spell, casting it when certain circumstances have been met. These circumstances are designated when you cast the spell and cannot be changed afterwards. The spell’s energy fades after 8 hours if it has not been triggered.
* **Coordinated Spell.** When you cast a spell using a spell slot, you can spend 2 sorcery points and touch a willing creature within reach to expend their spell slot instead of yours.

* **Brutal Spell.** When you cast a spell that requires an attack roll or affects a weapon, you may spend 1 sorcery point. If you do, the spell scores a critical hit on a 19 or 20. You can use Brutal Spell even if you have already used a different Metamagic option during the casting of the spell.
* **Stable Spell.** (testing) When a spell you cast would affected by counterspell or dispel magic, you may spend 2 sorcery points as a reaction to impose disadvantage on the check made by those spells. If your spell would be countered or dispelled without a roll, you instead force the roll to occur.

* **Piercing Spell.** When you choose this Metamagic option, choose a damage type.
When you roll damage of that type for a spell, you can spend 2 sorcery point to make the damage ignore resistance to that damage, and treat immunity to that damage as resistance.

* **Efficient Spell.** When you cast a spell of 2nd, 3rd, 4th or 5th level, you can spend a number of sorcery points equal to the spell's level to cast it using a spell slot one level lower than the spell's normal level, without changing the effects of the spell.

* **Widened Spell.** When you cast a spell that has an area effect, you can spend sorcery points equal to the spell's level to increase each of the area's dimensions by half, rounded down to the nearest 5 feet
