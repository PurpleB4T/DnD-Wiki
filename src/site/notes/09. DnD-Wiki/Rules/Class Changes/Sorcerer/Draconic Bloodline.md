[[09. DnD-Wiki/Rules/Class Changes/Sorcerer/Sorcerer\|Back to Sorcerer]]

**Your innate magic comes from draconic magic that was mingled with your blood or that of your ancestors. Most often, sorcerers with this origin trace their descent back to a mighty sorcerer of ancient times who made a bargain with a dragon or who might even have claimed a dragon parent. Some of these bloodlines are well established in the world, but most are obscure. Any given sorcerer could be the first of a new bloodline, as a result of a pact or some other exceptional circumstance.**

* **Dragon Ancestor:** Unchanged
* **Draconic Resilience:** Improved
* **Draconic Spell:** Added
* **Draconic Magic:** Added
* **Elemental Affinity:** Improved
* **Dragon Wings:** Unchanged
* **Draconic Presence:** Improved

### Dragon Ancestor
*(1st level feature)*

At 1st level, you choose one type of dragon as your ancestor. The damage type associated with each dragon is used by features you gain later.

| Dragon Color |	Damage Type |
| :--: | :--: |
| Black |	**Acid** |
| Blue |	**Lightning** |
| Brass |	**Fire** |
| Bronze |	**Lightning** |
| Copper |	**Acid** |
| Gold |	**Fire** |
| Green |	**Poison** |
| Red |	**Fire** |
| Silver |	**Cold** |
| White |	**Cold** |

You can speak, read, and write Draconic. Additionally, whenever you make a Charisma check when interacting with dragons, your proficiency bonus is doubled if it applies to the check.

### Draconic Resilience
*(Improved 1st level feature)*

As magic flows through your body, it causes physical traits of your dragon ancestors to emerge. At 1st level, your hit point maximum increases by 1 and increases by 1 again whenever you gain a level in this class.

Additionally, parts of your skin are covered by a thin sheen of dragon-like scales. When you aren't wearing armor, your AC equals 13 + your Dexterity modifier.

**You gain natural weapons in the form of claws, fangs or other physical manefistations (horns, spikes on tail, etc). They count as versatile, or you use your Charisma to attack. You are considered proficient with these weapons. They deal 1d6 slashing/piercing/bludgeoning damage + Char MOD.**

### Draconic Spell
*(Added 2nd level feature)*
The Draconic magic within you lets you inherently alter effects of your spells.
When you cast a spell that deals the type of damage associated with your draconic ancestry feature, you may spend 1 sorcery point. If the spell affects an area or multiple targets, you must spend 1 sorcery point for each target you wish to affect. After a target takes damage from the spell, they become immersed in magical energy and take 1d10 damage each round of the same damage type. An affected creature can spend an action and all of their movement to end this effect.


### Draconic Magic
*(Improves 1st level "Sorcerous Origins" feature)*

You learn additional spells when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown on the Draconic Spells table as well as the Ancestral Spells as determined by the type of your Dragon Ancestor. Damage from your Ancestral Spells count toward your Elemental Affinity feature. Each of these spells counts as a sorcerer spell for you, but it doesn't count against the number of sorcerer spells you know.

Whenever you gain a sorcerer level, you can replace one spell you gained from this feature with another spell of the same level. The new spell must be an evocation or an enchantment spell from the sorcerer, warlock, or wizard spell list.

### Draconic Resilience
As magic flows through your body, it causes physical traits of your dragon ancestors to emerge. At 1st level, your hit point maximum increases by 1 and increases by 1 again whenever you gain a level in this class.

Additionally, parts of your skin are covered by a thin sheen of dragon-like scales. When you aren't wearing armor, your AC equals 13 + your Dexterity modifier.

### Elemental Affinity
*(Improved 6th level feature)*

Starting at 6th level, your connection to your draconic ancestor grants you a portion of their elemental power, granting you the following benefits:

* **You gain resistance to the damage type associated with your draconic ancestry.**

* When you cast a spell that deals damage of the type associated with your draconic ancestry, you can add your Charisma modifier + Proficiency to one damage roll of that spell.

* When you cast a spell that deals damage other than piercing, bludgeoning or slashing, **you can change that damage type into the one associated with your draconic ancestry**. Once you change the damage type of spell in this way, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest.

### Dragon Wings
*(14th level feature)*

At 14th level, you gain the ability to sprout a pair of dragon wings from your back, gaining a flying speed equal to your current speed. 
Your wings are constantly present, but you can spend a bonus action to fold them in a way that they don't impede your or the people around yours movement. Armour and clothing you are wearing needs to be altered to accomodate for your wings.

### Draconic Presence
*(Improved 18th level feature)*

At 18th level, you can exude the terrifying or awe inspiring majesty of a true dragon. **You are immune to being Charmed or Frightened.** 

Additionally, as an action, you can emanate an aura of awe or fear (your choice) in a 60-foot radius.
For 1 minute, hostile creatures that start their turn within the aura must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be charmed (awe) or frightened (fear) until the aura ends. On a success, creatures are immune to this aura for 24 hours.

Once you use this action, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest, **unless you spend 5 sorcery points to use it again.**
