## Base Class Features
**Source:** The Player's Handbook.
* **Bardic Inspiration:** *Improved*
* **Countercharm:** *Re-Written*
* **Superior Inspiration:** *Improved*

### Spellcasting
*(Improved 1st level feature)*

You have learned to untangle and reshape the fabric of reality in harmony with your wishes and music. Your spells are part of your vast repertoire, magic that you can tune to different situations.

#### Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher

You know four 1st-level spells of your choice from the bard spell list.

The Spells Known column of the Bard table shows when you learn more bard spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 3rd level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.

Additionally, **whenever you finish a long rest** or gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the bard spells you know and replace it with another spell from the bard spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.



### Bardic Inspiration
*(Improved 1st level feature)*

You can inspire others through stirring words or music. To do so, you use a bonus action on your turn to choose one creature other than yourself within 60 feet of you who can hear you. That creature gains one Bardic Inspiration die, a d6.

Once within the next 10 minutes, the creature can roll the die and add the number rolled to one ability check, attack roll, or saving throw it makes. The creature can wait until after it rolls the d20 before deciding to use the Bardic Inspiration die, but must decide before the GM says whether the roll succeeds or fails. Once the Bardic Inspiration die is rolled, it is lost. A creature can have only one Bardic Inspiration die at a time.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (a minimum of once). You regain any expended uses when you finish a **short rest or long rest**.

Your Bardic Inspiration die changes when you reach certain levels in this class. The die becomes a d8 at 5th level, a d10 at 10th level, and a d12 at 15th level.

### Inspiring Example
*(Replaces 5th level "Font of Inspiration" feature)*

At 5th level, in order to encourage your allies, inspiration finds you and allows you to lead by example.

When you grant a creature a Bardic Inspiration die **you also gain a Bardic Inspiration die** of your own, which is a d6. The same rules of Bardic Inspiration apply to you as they normally would to another creature. 

Alternatively, while you have this die, you can choose to **expend it on a Bard feature that requires a bardic inspiration die**, provided that it doesn't grant the die to another creature for it to roll.

### Countercharm
*(Re-Written 6th level feature)*

At 6th level, you gain the ability to use musical notes or words of power to disrupt mind-influencing effects. 

As an action, you perform to any number of creatures of your choice within 30 feet of you that can hear you. Until the end of your next turn, **you and each target becomes immune** to one of the following conditions of your choice: Charmed or Frightened. If you or any target is currently affected by the condition you choose when you take this action, **that condition immediately ends.**

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (a minimum of once). You regain any expended uses when you finish a long rest.




### Superior Inspiration
*(Improved 20th level feature)*

At 20th level, when you roll for initiative you regain **all expended uses** of Bardic Inspiration if any are missing. 

Additionally, when you or an inspired ally rolls a 1 or a 2 on a bardic inspiration dice, **you can re-roll the die** and must use the new roll, even if the new roll is a 1 or a 2.
