### Peerless Skill
*(Re-Written 14th level feature)*

Starting at 14th level, whenever you fail an ability check, **you can reroll the d20 and must use the new roll**.

You can use this feature a number of times **equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of once)**, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.
