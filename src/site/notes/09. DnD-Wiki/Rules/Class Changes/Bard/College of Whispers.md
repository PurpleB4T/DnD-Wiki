### Words of Terror
*(Re-Written 3rd level feature)*

At 3rd level, you learn to infuse innocent-seeming words with an insidious magic that can inspire terror. 

If you speak to a **creature** for at least 1 minute, you can attempt to seed paranoia in its mind. At the end of the conversation, the target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC or be frightened of you or another creature of your choice. It automatically succeeds if it doesn't share a language with you or it can't hear you. The target is frightened in this way for 1 hour, until it is attacked or damaged, or until it witnesses its allies being attacked or damaged. 

If the target succeeds on its saving throw, the target has no hint that you tried to frighten it **and neither does any other creature that heard the conversation, if any**. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.
