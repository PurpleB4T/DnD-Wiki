[[09. DnD-Wiki/Rules/Class Changes/Wizard/Wizard\|Back to Wizard]]

**As a conjurer, you favor spells that produce objects and creatures out of thin air. You can conjure billowing clouds of killing fog or summon creatures from elsewhere to fight on your behalf. As your mastery grows, you learn spells of transportation and can teleport yourself across vast distances, even to other planes of existence, in an instant.**

### Conjuration Savant
*(2nd level feature)*

Beginning when you select this school at 2nd level, the gold and time you must spend to copy a Conjuration spell into your spellbook is halved.

### Minor Conjuration
*(Improved 2nd level feature)*

Starting at 2nd level when you select this school, you can use your action to conjure up an inanimate object or **10 pieces of ammunition** in your hand or on the ground in an unoccupied space that you can see within 10 feet of you. This object can be an **adventuring gear item** with a gold cost less than or equal to 5 times your wizard level or any object no larger than 5 cubic feet that weighs no more than 25 pounds. Either way the form must be that of a non-magical object that you have seen that can not be consumed.

The object is visibly magical, radiating dim light out to 5 feet. **Ammunition created this way is considered magical for the purposes of overcoming immunities and resistances.** The object disappears after 1 hour, when you use this feature again, or if it takes or deals any damage.

### Benign Transposition
*(Improved 6th level feature)*

At 6th level, you can use your **bonus action** to teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space that you can see. Alternatively, you can choose a space within range that is occupied by a Small or Medium creature. If that creature is willing, you both teleport, swapping places. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest or you cast a conjuration spell of 1st level or higher.

### Focused Conjuration
*(Improved 10th level feature)*

At 10th level, while you are concentrating on a conjuration spell, your concentration can't be broken as a result of taking damage. 

Furthermore,  whenever you cast a spell that summons a single creature, **you can choose to cast it without material components**. If you do so, **the spell's duration becomes 1 minute for that casting.**

### Durable Summons
*(Re-written 14th level feature)*

Starting at 14th level, any creature that you summon or create with a conjuration spell has temporary hit points **equal to twice your wizard level.**
