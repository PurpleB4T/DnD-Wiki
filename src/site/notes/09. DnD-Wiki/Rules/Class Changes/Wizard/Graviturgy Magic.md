[[09. DnD-Wiki/Rules/Class Changes/Wizard/Wizard\|Back to Wizard]]

**Understanding and mastering the forces that draw bodies of matter together or drive them apart, the students of the Graviturgy arcane tradition learn to further bend and manipulate the violent energy of gravity to their benefit, and the terrible detriment of their enemies.**

* **Adjust Density:** *Re-written*
* **Gravity Well:** *Improved*
* **Violent Attraction:** *Improved*
* **Event Horizon:** Unchanged

### Adjust Density
*(Re-written 2nd level feature)*

As an action, you can magically alter the weight of one object or creature you can see within 30 feet of you. The object or creature must be Large or smaller. The target's weight is halved or doubled for up to 1 minute. Only one target can benefit from this effect at a time

While the weight of a creature is halved by this effect, the creature's speed increases by 10 feet, it can jump twice as far as normal, and it has **advantage on Dexterity checks and Dexterity saving throws.**

While the weight of a creature is doubled by this effect, the creature can't be knocked prone unless it chooses to be or falls unconscious, and it has **advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws.**

Upon reaching 10th level in this class, you can target an object or a creature that is Huge or smaller.

### Gravity Well
*(Improved 6th level feature)*

You've learned how to manipulate gravity around living beings. 

Whenever you cast a spell on one or more creatures, you can select **a number of creatures up to your Intelligence modifier** (minimum of one) and move each target 5 feet to an unoccupied space of your choice if the target is willing to move, the spell hits it with an attack, or it fails a saving throw against the spell.

If the spell you cast requires concentration then you can move targets this way once per turn while you maintain concentration (no action required).

### Violent Repulsion
*(Replaces 10th level "Violent Attraction" feature)*

As a bonus action, you can **push any number of creatures of your choice** within 10 feet of you back by 15 feet, dealing 1d10 force damage to each target when you do.

Additionally, **attack rolls have disadvantage against you** as a lingering gravity field repels incoming strikes until the start of your next turn.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

### Event Horizon
*(14th level feature)*

As an action, you can magically emit a powerful field of gravitational energy that tugs at other creatures for up to 1 minute or until your concentration ends (as if you were concentrating on a spell). 

For the duration, whenever a creature hostile to you starts its turn within 30 feet of you, it must make a Strength saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, it takes 2d10 force damage, and its speed is reduced to 0 until the start of its next turn. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage, and every foot it moves this turn costs 2 extra feet of movement.

Once you use this feature, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest or until you expend a spell slot of 3rd level or higher to use it again.
