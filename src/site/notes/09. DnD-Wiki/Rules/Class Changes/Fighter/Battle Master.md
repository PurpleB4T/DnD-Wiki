### Combat Superiority
*(Re-written 3rd level feature)*

When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, your study of martial techniques allows you to specialize in combat maneuvers.

**Maneuvers.** You learn three maneuvers of your choice, which are listed under "Maneuvers". You can use only one maneuver per attack. You learn two additional maneuvers of your choice at 7th, 10th, and 15th level.

**Superiority Die.** You have four superiority dice, which are d8s. A superiority die is expended when you use it. You regain all of your expended superiority dice when you finish a short or long rest. You gain another superiority die at 7th level and one more at 15th level.

**Saving Throws.** Some of your maneuvers require your target to make a saving throw to resist the maneuver's effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:

**Maneuver save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength or Dexterity modifier (your choice)

**Combat Versatility.** You can change the list of maneuvers you know for different ones that are available from the list of Battle Master maneuvers whenever you finish a long rest, instead of replacing just one maneuver when you gain a level in this class.
