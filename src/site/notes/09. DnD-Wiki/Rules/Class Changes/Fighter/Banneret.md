### Bonus Proficiency
*(Re-written 3rd level feature)*

When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you gain **proficiency** in one of the following skills of your choice: Animal Handling, Insight, Intimidation, Persuasion or Performance.

### Banneret's Command
*(Replaces 3rd level feature)*

Starting at 3rd level, you learn how to coordinate with your allies. As a **bonus action**, choose one creature that you can see within 60 feet of you. If it can hear you or see you, you grant it one of the following benefits until the end of its next turn:

* **Assist.** The target receives the benefit of the **help** action, which can be used to aid it in attacking a creature within 60 feet of you that you can see instead of 5 feet.

* **Retreat.** The target receives the benefit of the **disengage** action.

### Rallying Cry
*(Re-written 3rd level feature moved to 7th level)*

At 7th level, the force of your will inspires resolve within your allies. 

As a bonus action you can target yourself and a number of creatures equal to your **proficiency bonus** within 60 feet of you that can see or hear you. Each target gains a number of temporary hit points equal to **1d6 + your fighter level**. 

While a creature has these temporary hit points it can not be charmed or frightened. If any of the targets are charmed or frightened when they receive these temporary hit points, the condition is suspended until the temporary hits points are lost.

One you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

### Regal Envoy
*(Replaces 7th level "Royal Envoy" feature)*

At 7th level, your training allows you to conduct yourself with the poise and grace of nobility. You can add **half your proficiency bonus (rounded up) to any Charisma check** you make that doesn't already make use of your proficiency bonus.

### Inspiring Surge
*(Re-written 10th level feature)*

At 10th level, when you push yourself beyond your limits, you inspire your allies to do the same. 

Whenever you use your Action Surge feature, you can choose a number of creatures equal to your **proficiency bonus** within 60 feet of you that can see or hear you and grant each of them an **additional action** that they can use on their next turn.

That action can be used only to take the Attack (one weapon attack only), Dash, Disengage, Dodge, or Use an Object action.

### Indomitable Spirit
*(Re-written 15th level "Bulwark" feature)*

At 15th level, your determination extends to your allies, encouraging them to persist even in the face of failure. 

When a friendly creature within 60 feet of you that can see or hear you **fails a saving throw**, you can use your reaction to **allow it to re-roll its saving throw**. Once it does so, it must use the new roll. 

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your **proficiency bonus**, and you regain all expended uses whenever you finish a long rest.

### No Surrender
*(Added 18th level feature)*

Starting at 18th level, your rallying cry inspires your allies to turn the tide of battle. 

Whenever a creature gains temporary hit points from your Rallying Cry, it can immediately **use its reaction (if available) to move up to its speed, without provoking opportunity attacks.**

Additionally, all targets including yourself have advantage on attack rolls and saving throws until the end of your next turn.
