### Giant's Might
*(Re-written 3rd level feature)*

You have learned how to imbue yourself with the might of giants. As a bonus action, you magically gain the following benefits, which last for 1 minute: 
* If you are smaller than Large, you become Large, along with anything you are wearing. If you lack the room to become Large, your size doesn't change.
* You have advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws.
* **Your attacks with a weapon or an unarmed strike deal an extra 1d4 damage to a target on a hit.**

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses of it when you finish a long rest.

### Great Stature
*(Reworked 10th level feature)*

By 10th level, the magic of your runes permanently alters your body, granting you a portion of a giant's strength. 

**You gain the powerful build trait** if you don't already have it, meaning you count as one size larger when determining your carrying weight and the weight you can push, drag, or lift.

Moreover, when you gain this feature, roll 3d4. You grow a number of inches in height equal to the roll.


### Runic Juggernaut
*(Re-written 18th level feature)*

At 18th level, you learn how to amplify your rune-powered transformation. As a result, when you use your Giantâ€™s Might feature, your size can increase to Huge. While you are that size, you gain the following benefits: 
* **Your movement speed increases by 10 feet.**
* Your reach increases by 5 feet.
* **The damage you deal with your Giant's Might feature increases to 1d6.**
