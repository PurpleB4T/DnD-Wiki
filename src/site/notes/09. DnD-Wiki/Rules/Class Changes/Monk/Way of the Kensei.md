### Sharpen the Blade
*(Improved 11th level feature moved to 10th level)*

At 10th level, you gain the ability to augment your weapons further with your ki. 

As a bonus action, you can expend up to 3 ki points to grant one kensei weapon you touch a bonus to attack and damage rolls when you attack with it. The bonus equals the number of ki points you spent. This bonus lasts for **1 hour** or until you use this feature again. This feature has no effect on a magic weapon that already has a bonus to attack and damage rolls.

### Unerring Accuracy

At 17th level, your mastery of weapons grants you extraordinary accuracy. Once per turn, if you miss with an attack roll while using a monk weapon, **you can make another attack with that weapon against the same target with advantage**.
