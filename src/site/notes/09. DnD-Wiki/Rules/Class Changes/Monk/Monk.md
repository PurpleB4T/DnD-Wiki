### Martial Arts
*(Improved 1st level feature)*

At 1st level, your practice of martial arts gives you mastery of combat styles that use unarmed strikes and monk weapons, which are shortswords and any simple melee weapons that don’t have the two-handed or heavy property.

You gain the following benefits while you are unarmed or wielding only monk weapons **and you aren't wearing heavy armor:**

* You can use Dexterity instead of Strength for the attack and damage rolls of your unarmed strikes and monk weapons.
* When you make an Athletics checks to grapple or shove, **you can use Dexterity instead of strength for the ability check**.
* You can roll a **d6** in place of the normal damage of your unarmed strike or monk weapon. This die changes as you gain monk levels, as shown in the Martial Arts column of the Monk table.
* When you use the Attack action with an unarmed strike or a monk weapon on your turn **while not wielding a shield**, you can make one additional attack with an unarmed strike **or monk weapon** as a bonus action.

### Ki
*(Re-written 2nd level feature)*

Starting at 2nd level, your training allows you to harness the mystic energy of ki. Your access to this energy is represented by a number of ki points. **You have 4 ki points**. At 5th level you have a total of ki points equal to your monk level.

You can spend these points to fuel various ki features. You start knowing two such features: Flurry of Blows and Patient Defense. You learn more ki features as you gain levels in this class.

When you spend a ki point, it is unavailable until you finish a short or long rest, at the end of which you draw all of your expended ki back into yourself. You must spend at least 30 minutes of the rest meditating to regain your ki points.

Some of your ki features require your target to make a saving throw to resist the feature's effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:

###### **Ki save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier

#### Flurry of Blows

Immediately after you take the Attack action on your turn, you can spend 1 ki point to make two unarmed strikes as a bonus action **if you are not wielding a shield**.

#### Enduring Defense

You can spend 1 ki point to **gain temporary hit points equal to one roll of your martial arts die + your wisdom modifier** as a bonus action.


### Step of the Wind
*(Re-written 2nd level "Unarmored Movement" feature)*

Starting at 2nd level, while you are not wearing heavy armor or wielding a shield you gain the following benefits:

* **You can take the dash or disengage action as a bonus action.** When you do, your jump distance is doubled for that turn.

* Your speed increases by 10 feet. This bonus increases when you reach certain monk levels, as shown in the Monk table.

* At 9th level, you gain the ability to move along vertical surfaces and across liquids on your turn without falling during the move.

* At 15th level, **you gain the ability to move upside down along ceilings** while leaving your hands free on your turn without falling during the move.

### Dedicated Weapon 
*(Optional 2nd level feature)*
Also at 2nd level, you train yourself to use a variety of weapons as monk weapons, not just simple melee weapons and shortswords. Whenever you finish a short or long rest, you can touch one weapon, focus your ki on it, and then count that weapon as a monk weapon until you use this feature again.

The chosen weapon must meet these criteria:
- The weapon must be a simple or martial weapon.
- You must be proficient with it.
- It must lack the heavy and special properties.

### Deflect Attack
*(Re-written 3rd level "Deflect Missiles" feature)*

Starting at 3rd level, while you are not wearing heavy armor or wielding a shield, you can use your reaction to deflect a blow when you are hit by a **weapon attack**. When you do so, the damage you take from the attack is reduced by **one roll of your martial arts die** + your Dexterity **or Strength modifier + your proficiency bonus**.

#### Deflect Blow
If you reduce the damage of a melee weapon attack to 0 and the target is Large or smaller, you can spend 1 Ki point to force the target to make a Strength saving throw against your Ki save DC. On a failed save, you can either push the target up to 5 feet away from you or knock it Prone.

\pagebreak
#### Deflect Missile. 
If you reduce the damage of a ranged weapon attack to 0, you can catch the missile if it is small enough for you to hold in one hand and you have at least one hand free.

If you catch a missile in this way, you can spend 1 Ki point to make a ranged attack with the weapon or piece of ammunition you just caught, as part of the same reaction.

You make this attack with proficiency, regardless of your weapon proficiencies, and the missile counts as a monk weapon for the attack, which has a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet.


### Ki-Fueled Attack
*(Re-written 3rd level feature)*

At 3rd level, if you spend 1 ki point or more as part of your action on your turn, you can use your bonus action to make one attack with an unarmed strike or a monk weapon before the end of the turn.


### Monastic Tradition
*(Moved feature gained at 11th level to 10th level)*

When you reach 3rd level, you commit yourself to a monastic tradition, chosen from the list of available traditions. Your tradition grants you features at 3rd level and again at 6th, **10th**, and 17th level.

### Slow Fall
*(4th level feature)*

Beginning at 4th level, you can use your reaction when you fall to reduce any falling damage you take by an amount equal to five times your monk level.

### Quickened Healing 
*(Optional 4th level feature)*

Also at 4th level, as an action, you can spend 2 ki points and roll a Martial Arts die. You regain a number of hit points equal to the number rolled plus your proficiency bonus.

### Ki-Inhibiting Strikes
*(Re-written 5th level "Stunning Strike" feature)*

You can interfere with the flow of ki in an opponent's body in various ways.

When you hit a creature with a monk weapon or an unarmed strike, you can spend 1 ki point to use one of the following features. You can't target the same creature more than once a turn with these features.

#### Disorienting Strike
You overload the target's mind, disrupting its ability to take actions. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be disoriented until the end of your next turn.

While disoriented, the creature can't take reactions, and on its turn, it can use either an action or a bonus action, not both; in addition, regardless of its abilities or magic items, the creature can't make more than one melee or ranged attack during its turn, and it can't concentrate on spells or other effects that require it.

A creature is immune to this affect if it is also immune to being Stunned.

####  Immobolizing Strike
You overload the target's joints and muscles, preventing it from moving. The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be Immobolized until the end of your next turn.

While immobolized, the creature's speed becomes 0, and it can't benefit from any bonus to its speed. Additionally, the creature makes Dexterity saving throws with disadvantage.

A creature is immune to this affect if it is also immune to being Stunned.

####  Insensating Strike
You overload the target's senses and prevent them from functioning properly. The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or become Blinded, Deafened or Silenced (your choice) until the end of your next turn.



### Ki-Empowered Strikes
*(6th level feature)*

Starting at 6th level, your unarmed strikes count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.

### Evasion
*(7th level feature)*

At 7th level, your instinctive agility lets you dodge out of the way of certain area effects, such as a blue dragon's lightning breath or a fireball spell. When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.

### Stillness of Mind
*(7th level feature)*

Starting at 7th level, you can use your action to end one effect on yourself that is causing you to be charmed or frightened.

### Purity of Body
*(Moved 10th level feature to 9th level)*

At 9th level, your mastery of the ki flowing through you makes you immune to disease and poison.

### Improved Ki-Techniques
*(Added 11th level feature)*

At 11th level, your proficiency over Ki allows you to further empower your techniques.

#### Improved Flurry of Blows

When you spend a ki point to use Flurry of blows as a bonus action, you can make a total of three unarmed strikes instead of two.

#### Improved Enduring Defense

When you spend a ki point to use Enduring Defense as a bonus action, **you can also take the Dodge action as a part of the same bonus action**.

\pagebreak
### Tongue of the Sun and Moon
*(Improved 13th level feature)*

Starting at 13th level, **you can use Wisdom, in place of Charimsa, whenever you make a Deception, Persuasion or Intimidation check.**

Additionally, you learn to touch the ki of other minds so that you can understand all spoken languages and be understood by any creature that can understand a language. **As an action, you can touch another creature to grant it this benefit for 1 hour.**

### Diamond Soul
*(Improved 14th level feature)*

Beginning at 14th level, your mastery of ki grants you proficiency in all saving throws.

Additionally, whenever you make a saving throw and fail, you can spend 1 ki point to reroll it and take the second result. **You do not spend the ki point if this second result is also a failure.**

### Timeless Body
*(15th level feature)*

At 15th level, your ki sustains you so that you suffer none of the frailty of old age, and you can't be aged magically. You can still die of old age, however. In addition, you no longer need food or water.

### Empty Body
*(18th level feature)*

Beginning at 18th level, you can use your action to spend 4 ki points to become invisible for 1 minute. During that time, you also have resistance to all damage but force damage.

Additionally, you can spend 8 ki points to cast the astral projection spell, without needing material components. When you do so, you can't take any other creatures with you.

### Perfect Self
*(Improved 20th level feature)*

At 20th level, your Dexterity and Wisdom scores **increase by 4.** Your maximum for those scores is now **24.** 

Additionally, **if you start your turn with no ki points, you immediately regain 1 ki point.**
