## Way of the Sun Soul

* **Radiant Sunbolt:** *Improved*
* **Searing Arc Strike:** *Re-Written*
* **Searing Sunburst:** *Re-Written*
* **Sun Shield:** *Relocated and Re-Written*
* **Aura of Light :** *Added*

### Radiant Sunbolt
*(Improved 3rd level feature)*

Starting when you choose this tradition at 3rd level, your hands can produce searing bolts of magical radiance. **You know the Light cantrip** and wisdom is your spellcasting ability for it. You can use this spell to make your hands emit light.

You also gain the means to fire a Radiant Sunbolt with your Attack action. This Radiant Sunbolt is a ranged spell attack with a range of 30 feet that uses your martial arts die for damage and **can be used in place of your unarmed strikes**. You use your dexterity modifier for its attack and damage rolls, and the damage type is radiant.


### Sun Soul Technique
*(Re-Written 17th level feature relocated to 6th level)*

At 6th level, you have trained to effectively channel your ki into radiant energy, granting you the following techniques. 

You can use these abilities a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest. While you have no uses available, you can spend 2 ki points to use either ability again.

**Searing Arc Strike.** When you take the Attack action on your turn, you can replace one of the attacks with a wave of radiant energy in either a 15-foot cone or a 30-foot line that is 5 feet wide (your choice). Each creature in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw against your Ki save DC, taking radiant damage equal to three rolls of your Martial Arts die on a failure, or half as much damage on a success. 

**Sun Shield.** When you are attacked by a creature within 30 feet of you that you can see, you can use your reaction to increase your AC by an amount equal to your proficiency bonus against that attack, causing your form to be obscured by brilliant light for a brief instant. If this causes the attack to miss you, you deal radiant damage equal to one roll of your martial arts die against the attacker. A creature that can't be blinded is immune to this feature.



### Searing Sunburst
*(Re-written 11th level feature moved to 10th level)*

At 10th level, you gain the ability to create an orb of light that erupts into a devastating explosion.

As an action, you can magically create an orb and hurl it at a point you choose within 150 feet, where it erupts into a sphere of radiant light for a brief but deadly instant.

Each creature in that 20-foot-radius sphere must make a Constitution saving throw against your Ki save DC, taking radiant damage equal to **four rolls of your Martial Arts die** and becoming **blinded** until the end of your next turn on a failure, otherwise they take half as much damage and don't become blinded on a success. A creature doesn't need to make the save if the creature is behind total cover that is opaque. 

Once you use this action, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest, unless you spend 3 ki points to use it again.

### Aura of Light
*(Re-written 17th level feature)*

At 17th level, you can channel your ki to become a beacon of a luminous, magical sunlight. You can activate this aura as a bonus action, granting yourself the following benefits for 1 minute:

* You shed bright sun light in a 30 foot radius and dim sun light for an additional 30 feet. You can extinguish or restore the light as a bonus action.
* You gain a flying speed equal to your walking speed.
* You become immune to radiant damage and the blinded condition

These benefits last for a 1 minute or until you use a bonus action to end it early. Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest, unless you spend 4 ki points to use it again.
