## Way of the Open Hand </h2>

**Source:** Player's Handbook.
* **Open Hand Technique:** Unchanged
* **Wholeness of Body:** Unchanged
* **Tranquility:** *Improved*
* **Quivering Palm:** *Re-written*

### Open Hand Technique
*(3rd level feature)*

Starting when you choose this tradition at 3rd level, you can manipulate your enemy's ki when you harness your own. Whenever you hit a creature with one of the attacks granted by your Flurry of Blows, you can impose one of the following effects on that target:

It must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be knocked prone.
It must make a Strength saving throw. If it fails, you can push it up to 15 feet away from you.
It can't take reactions until the end of your next turn.

### Wholeness of Body
*(6th level feature)*

At 6th level, you gain the ability to heal yourself. As an action, you can regain hit points equal to three times your monk level. You must finish a long rest before you can use this feature again.

### Tranquility
*(Improved 11th level feature moved to 10th level)*

Beginning at 11th level, you can enter a special meditation that surrounds you with an aura of peace. 

At the end of a **short rest**, you gain the effect of a Sanctuary spell that lasts until the start of your next **short rest**. The spell can end early as normal and you use your Ki save DC for the spell's saving throw.

While you are under the effects of the Sanctuary spell from this feature, you have **advantage on Wisdom (Animal Handling) checks as well as Charisma (Persuasion) checks**.

### Quivering Palm
*(Re-written 17th level feature)*

At 17th level, you gain the ability to set up lethal vibrations in someone's body. 

When you hit a creature with an unarmed strike, you can start these imperceptible vibrations, which last for a number of days equal to your monk level. The vibrations are harmless unless you use your action to end them. To do so, you and the target must be on the same plane of existence. When you use this action, the creature must make a Constitution saving throw, taking 10d10 necrotic damage on a failed save **or half as much on a successful one**. 

You can have only one creature under the effect of this feature at a time. You can choose to end the vibrations harmlessly without using an action. 

Once you use this feature, **you canâ€™t use it again until you finish a long rest, unless you spend 5 ki points to use it again.**
