### Drunkard's Talents
*(Improved 3rd level "Bonus Proficiencies" feature)*

When you choose this tradition at 3rd level, your martial arts technique mixes combat training with the precision of a dancer and the antics of a jester. 

You gain proficiency in the Performance skill, Brewer's supplies and improvised weapons. Improvised weapons without the heavy property count as monk weapons for you.


### Drunken Technique
*(Improved 3rd level feature)*

At 3rd level, you learn how to twist and turn quickly as part of your martial arts.

Whenever you use Flurry of Blows, you gain the benefit of the Disengage action, and your walking speed increases by 10 feet until the end of the current turn.

Additionally, you can make an unarmed strike as a bonus action **without** needing to take the attack action.

### Drunkard's Luck
*(Improved 11th level feature moved to 10th level)*

Starting at 10th level, you always seem to get a lucky bounce at the right moment. 

When you make an ability check, an attack roll, or a saving throw and have disadvantage, you can spend 2 ki points to cancel the disadvantage for that roll.

In addition, **you can not have disadvantage on melee attack rolls from being prone** and enemies can not gain advantage on melee attack rolls against you as a result of you being prone.
