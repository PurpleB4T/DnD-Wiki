## Way of Shadow 

**Source:** Player's Handbook.
* **Disciple of Shadow:** *Added*
* **Shadow Arts:** *Improved*
* **Shadow Step:** Unchanged
* **Cloak of Shadows:** *Improved*
* **Opportunist:** *Improved*

### Disciple of Shadow
*(Added 3rd level feature)*

Starting when you choose this tradition at 3rd level, you gain darkvision out to a range of 60 feet. If you already have darkvision, it increases by 30 feet.

In addition, you have advantage on any Dexterity (Stealth) checks you make while you are in dim light or darkness.

### Shadow Arts
*(Improved 3rd level feature)*

Starting at 3rd level, you can use your ki to duplicate the effects of certain spells. You gain the Minor Illusion cantrip if you don't already know it.

Additionally, as an action, you can cast the Darkness, Darkvision, Pass without Trace or Silence spells without providing material components. You can see through magical darkness produced by the effects of any spell you cast this way.

You can cast each spell once, and you regain the ability to cast them this way when you finish a long rest. While you have no uses available, **you can spend 2 ki points to cast one of these spells again.**



### Cloak of Shadows
*(Improved 11th level feature moved to 10th level)*

By 10th level, you have learned to become one with the shadows. 

Once per turn when you miss with an unarmed strike while you are in an area of dim light or darkness, **you can immediately make another unarmed strike against the same target.** 

Additionally, when you are in an area of dim light or darkness, you can use your action to become invisible. You remain invisible until you make an attack, cast a spell, or are in an area of bright light.

### Opportunist
*(Improved 17th level feature)*

At 17th level, you know how to exploit openings in your enemies defenses. 

Whenever a creature within 30 feet of you is hit by an attack made by a creature other than you,  you can use your reaction to **move up to half your movement speed (moving only towards that creature)** and make a melee attack against that creature if it is within reach.

Additionally, a creature has **disadvantage on saving throws** to resist your Ki-inhibiting strikes if you hit the creature with an attack while **hidden from it.**
