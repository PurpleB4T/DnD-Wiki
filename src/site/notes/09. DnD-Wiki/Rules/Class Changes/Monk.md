### Martial Arts
*(Improved 1st level feature)*

At 1st level, your practice of martial arts gives you mastery of combat styles that use unarmed strikes and monk weapons, which are shortswords and any simple melee weapons that don’t have the two-handed or heavy property.

You gain the following benefits while you are unarmed or wielding only monk weapons **and you aren't wearing heavy armor:**

* You can use Dexterity instead of Strength for the attack and damage rolls of your unarmed strikes and monk weapons.
* When you make an Athletics checks to grapple or shove, **you can use Dexterity instead of strength for the ability check**.
* You can roll a **d6** in place of the normal damage of your unarmed strike or monk weapon. This die changes as you gain monk levels, as shown in the Martial Arts column of the Monk table.
* When you use the Attack action with an unarmed strike or a monk weapon on your turn **while not wielding a shield**, you can make one additional attack with an unarmed strike **or monk weapon** as a bonus action.

### Ki
*(Re-written 2nd level feature)*

Starting at 2nd level, your training allows you to harness the mystic energy of ki. Your access to this energy is represented by a number of ki points. **You have 4 ki points**. At 5th level you have a total of ki points equal to your monk level.

You can spend these points to fuel various ki features. You start knowing two such features: Flurry of Blows and Patient Defense. You learn more ki features as you gain levels in this class.

When you spend a ki point, it is unavailable until you finish a short or long rest, at the end of which you draw all of your expended ki back into yourself. You must spend at least 30 minutes of the rest meditating to regain your ki points.

Some of your ki features require your target to make a saving throw to resist the feature's effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:

###### **Ki save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier

#### Flurry of Blows

Immediately after you take the Attack action on your turn, you can spend 1 ki point to make two unarmed strikes as a bonus action **if you are not wielding a shield**.

#### Enduring Defense

You can spend 1 ki point to **gain temporary hit points equal to one roll of your martial arts die + your wisdom modifier** as a bonus action.


### Step of the Wind
*(Re-written 2nd level "Unarmored Movement" feature)*

Starting at 2nd level, while you are not wearing heavy armor or wielding a shield you gain the following benefits:

* **You can take the dash or disengage action as a bonus action.** When you do, your jump distance is doubled for that turn.

* Your speed increases by 10 feet. This bonus increases when you reach certain monk levels, as shown in the Monk table.

* At 9th level, you gain the ability to move along vertical surfaces and across liquids on your turn without falling during the move.

* At 15th level, **you gain the ability to move upside down along ceilings** while leaving your hands free on your turn without falling during the move.

### Dedicated Weapon 
*(Optional 2nd level feature)*
Also at 2nd level, you train yourself to use a variety of weapons as monk weapons, not just simple melee weapons and shortswords. Whenever you finish a short or long rest, you can touch one weapon, focus your ki on it, and then count that weapon as a monk weapon until you use this feature again.

The chosen weapon must meet these criteria:
- The weapon must be a simple or martial weapon.
- You must be proficient with it.
- It must lack the heavy and special properties.

### Deflect Attack
*(Re-written 3rd level "Deflect Missiles" feature)*

Starting at 3rd level, while you are not wearing heavy armor or wielding a shield, you can use your reaction to deflect a blow when you are hit by a **weapon attack**. When you do so, the damage you take from the attack is reduced by **one roll of your martial arts die** + your Dexterity **or Strength modifier + your proficiency bonus**.

#### Deflect Blow
If you reduce the damage of a melee weapon attack to 0 and the target is Large or smaller, you can spend 1 Ki point to force the target to make a Strength saving throw against your Ki save DC. On a failed save, you can either push the target up to 5 feet away from you or knock it Prone.

\pagebreak
#### Deflect Missile. 
If you reduce the damage of a ranged weapon attack to 0, you can catch the missile if it is small enough for you to hold in one hand and you have at least one hand free.

If you catch a missile in this way, you can spend 1 Ki point to make a ranged attack with the weapon or piece of ammunition you just caught, as part of the same reaction.

You make this attack with proficiency, regardless of your weapon proficiencies, and the missile counts as a monk weapon for the attack, which has a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet.


### Ki-Fueled Attack
*(Re-written 3rd level feature)*

At 3rd level, if you spend 1 ki point or more as part of your action on your turn, you can use your bonus action to make one attack with an unarmed strike or a monk weapon before the end of the turn.


### Monastic Tradition
*(Moved feature gained at 11th level to 10th level)*

When you reach 3rd level, you commit yourself to a monastic tradition, chosen from the list of available traditions. Your tradition grants you features at 3rd level and again at 6th, **10th**, and 17th level.

### Slow Fall
*(4th level feature)*

Beginning at 4th level, you can use your reaction when you fall to reduce any falling damage you take by an amount equal to five times your monk level.

### Quickened Healing 
*(Optional 4th level feature)*

Also at 4th level, as an action, you can spend 2 ki points and roll a Martial Arts die. You regain a number of hit points equal to the number rolled plus your proficiency bonus.

### Ki-Inhibiting Strikes
*(Re-written 5th level "Stunning Strike" feature)*

You can interfere with the flow of ki in an opponent's body in various ways.

When you hit a creature with a monk weapon or an unarmed strike, you can spend 1 ki point to use one of the following features. You can't target the same creature more than once a turn with these features.

#### Disorienting Strike
You overload the target's mind, disrupting its ability to take actions. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be disoriented until the end of your next turn.

While disoriented, the creature can't take reactions, and on its turn, it can use either an action or a bonus action, not both; in addition, regardless of its abilities or magic items, the creature can't make more than one melee or ranged attack during its turn, and it can't concentrate on spells or other effects that require it.

A creature is immune to this affect if it is also immune to being Stunned.

####  Immobolizing Strike
You overload the target's joints and muscles, preventing it from moving. The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be Immobolized until the end of your next turn.

While immobolized, the creature's speed becomes 0, and it can't benefit from any bonus to its speed. Additionally, the creature makes Dexterity saving throws with disadvantage.

A creature is immune to this affect if it is also immune to being Stunned.

####  Insensating Strike
You overload the target's senses and prevent them from functioning properly. The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or become Blinded, Deafened or Silenced (your choice) until the end of your next turn.



### Ki-Empowered Strikes
*(6th level feature)*

Starting at 6th level, your unarmed strikes count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.

### Evasion
*(7th level feature)*

At 7th level, your instinctive agility lets you dodge out of the way of certain area effects, such as a blue dragon's lightning breath or a fireball spell. When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.

### Stillness of Mind
*(7th level feature)*

Starting at 7th level, you can use your action to end one effect on yourself that is causing you to be charmed or frightened.

### Purity of Body
*(Moved 10th level feature to 9th level)*

At 9th level, your mastery of the ki flowing through you makes you immune to disease and poison.

### Improved Ki-Techniques
*(Added 11th level feature)*

At 11th level, your proficiency over Ki allows you to further empower your techniques.

#### Improved Flurry of Blows

When you spend a ki point to use Flurry of blows as a bonus action, you can make a total of three unarmed strikes instead of two.

#### Improved Enduring Defense

When you spend a ki point to use Enduring Defense as a bonus action, **you can also take the Dodge action as a part of the same bonus action**.

\pagebreak
### Tongue of the Sun and Moon
*(Improved 13th level feature)*

Starting at 13th level, **you can use Wisdom, in place of Charimsa, whenever you make a Deception, Persuasion or Intimidation check.**

Additionally, you learn to touch the ki of other minds so that you can understand all spoken languages and be understood by any creature that can understand a language. **As an action, you can touch another creature to grant it this benefit for 1 hour.**

### Diamond Soul
*(Improved 14th level feature)*

Beginning at 14th level, your mastery of ki grants you proficiency in all saving throws.

Additionally, whenever you make a saving throw and fail, you can spend 1 ki point to reroll it and take the second result. **You do not spend the ki point if this second result is also a failure.**

### Timeless Body
*(15th level feature)*

At 15th level, your ki sustains you so that you suffer none of the frailty of old age, and you can't be aged magically. You can still die of old age, however. In addition, you no longer need food or water.

### Empty Body
*(18th level feature)*

Beginning at 18th level, you can use your action to spend 4 ki points to become invisible for 1 minute. During that time, you also have resistance to all damage but force damage.

Additionally, you can spend 8 ki points to cast the astral projection spell, without needing material components. When you do so, you can't take any other creatures with you.

### Perfect Self
*(Improved 20th level feature)*

At 20th level, your Dexterity and Wisdom scores **increase by 4.** Your maximum for those scores is now **24.**

<h2 id="Way-of-the-Sun-Soul"> Way of the Sun Soul </h2>

* **Aura of Light :** *Added*

### Radiant Sunbolt
*(Improved 3rd level feature)*

Starting when you choose this tradition at 3rd level, your hands can produce searing bolts of magical radiance. **You know the Light cantrip** and wisdom is your spellcasting ability for it. You can use this spell to make your hands emit light.

You also gain the means to fire a Radiant Sunbolt with your Attack action. This Radiant Sunbolt is a ranged spell attack with a range of 30 feet that uses your martial arts die for damage and **can be used in place of your unarmed strikes**. You use your dexterity modifier for its attack and damage rolls, and the damage type is radiant.


### Sun Soul Technique
*(Re-Written 17th level feature relocated to 6th level)*

At 6th level, you have trained to effectively channel your ki into radiant energy, granting you the following techniques. 

You can use these abilities a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest. While you have no uses available, you can spend 2 ki points to use either ability again.

**Searing Arc Strike.** When you take the Attack action on your turn, you can replace one of the attacks with a wave of radiant energy in either a 15-foot cone or a 30-foot line that is 5 feet wide (your choice). Each creature in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw against your Ki save DC, taking radiant damage equal to three rolls of your Martial Arts die on a failure, or half as much damage on a success. 

**Sun Shield.** When you are attacked by a creature within 30 feet of you that you can see, you can use your reaction to increase your AC by an amount equal to your proficiency bonus against that attack, causing your form to be obscured by brilliant light for a brief instant. If this causes the attack to miss you, you deal radiant damage equal to one roll of your martial arts die against the attacker. A creature that can't be blinded is immune to this feature.



### Searing Sunburst
*(Re-written 11th level feature moved to 10th level)*

At 10th level, you gain the ability to create an orb of light that erupts into a devastating explosion.

As an action, you can magically create an orb and hurl it at a point you choose within 150 feet, where it erupts into a sphere of radiant light for a brief but deadly instant.

Each creature in that 20-foot-radius sphere must make a Constitution saving throw against your Ki save DC, taking radiant damage equal to **four rolls of your Martial Arts die** and becoming **blinded** until the end of your next turn on a failure, otherwise they take half as much damage and don't become blinded on a success. A creature doesn't need to make the save if the creature is behind total cover that is opaque. 

Once you use this action, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest, unless you spend 3 ki points to use it again.

### Aura of Light
*(Re-written 17th level feature)*

At 17th level, you can channel your ki to become a beacon of a luminous, magical sunlight. You can activate this aura as a bonus action, granting yourself the following benefits for 1 minute:

<h2 id="Way-of-the-Four-Elements"> Way of the Four Elements </h2>

**Source:** Player's Handbook.
* **Disciple of the Elements:** *Re-Written*
* **Elemental Attunement:** *Added*
* **Elemental Deflection:** *Added*
* **Elemental Strikes:** *Added*
* **Avatar of the Elements:** *Added*

### Disciple of the Elements
*(Improved 3rd level feature)*

When you choose this tradition at 3rd level, you learn magical disciplines that harness the power of the four elements.

#### Disciplines Known
You know three elemental disciplines of your choice. You learn two additional disciplines of your choice at 6th, 11th and 17th level.

Whenever you learn a new elemental discipline, you can also replace one discipline that you already know with a different discipline.

#### Elemental Ki
You gain an **additional pool of ki points equal to half your monk level (rounded up)**. You can use either pool of ki points to cast your elemental disciplines but your elemental ki points can not be used for any monk ability that isn't an elemental discipline. 

You regain all expended elemental ki points when you finish a long rest.

\pagebreak
#### Casting Elemental Spells 
Some elemental disciplines allow you to cast spells. See chapter 10 for the general rules of spellcasting. To cast one of these spells, you use its casting time and other rules, but you don't need to provide material components for it.

Once you reach 5th level in this class, you can spend additional ki points to increase the level of that spell, provided that the spell has an enhanced effect at a higher level, as Burning Hands does. The spell's level increases by 1 for each additional ki point you spend. For example, if you are a 5th-level monk and use Sweeping Cinder Strike to cast Burning Hands, you can spend 3 ki points to cast it as a 2nd-level spell (the discipline's base cost of 2 ki points plus 1).

The maximum number of ki points you can spend to cast a spell in this way (including its base ki point cost and any additional ki points you spend to increase its level) is determined by your monk level, as shown in the Spells and Ki Points table.

##### Spells and Ki Points

| Monk Levels  | Maximum Ki Points for a Spell |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  5th-8th  | 3 |
|  9th-12th | 4 |
|  13th-16th | 5 |
|  17th-20th | 6 |


### Elemental Attunement
*(Added 3rd level feature)*

When you choose this tradition at 3rd level, you learn Primordial, the language of the elements, including all four of its dialects.

In addition you learn two cantrips of your choice: Control Flames, Gust, Mold Earth, or Shape Water. Wisdom is your spellcasting modifier for these spells. You learn an additional cantrip from this list when you reach 6th and 11th level in this class.

### Elemental Deflection
*(Added 6th level feature)*

Starting at 6th level, your mystical attunement allows you to call upon the elements to defend yourself from magical attacks. When you take damage from a ranged spell attack, you can use your reaction to reduce the damage by 1d10 + your Wisdom modifier (minimum reduction of 1). 

You can not use this feature to deflect spells that do not make an attack roll such as magic missile.

### Elemental Strikes
*(Added 10th level feature)*

Starting at 10th level, your strikes become imbued with the power of the elements.
As a free action once on each of your turns, you can choose to magically imbue your unarmed strikes with one of the four elements.

**Earth.** Your unarmed strikes deal an additional martial arts die of bludgeoning damage to objects and constructs.

**Fire.** Your unarmed strikes deal fire damage, you emit bright light in a 20 foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet. You can choose to ignite a flammable object that isn’t worn or carried by touching it.

**Water.** Your unarmed strikes deal cold damage and creatures grappled by you are considered restrained.

**Air.** Your unarmed strikes deal thunder damage and whenever you shove a creature you can push them up to 15 feet away.

### Master of the Elements 
*(Added 17th level feature)*

Starting at 17th level, the following four spells are added to your Elemental Disciples list:

* **Investiture of Fire**
* **Investiture of Ice**
* **Investiture of Stone**
* **Investiture of Wind**

You can cast one of these spells once without expending ki points. Once you do so, you can’t cast it again until you finish a long rest, unless you spend 6 ki points to cast it again.
