* (a) two handaxes or (b) any simple weapon
* An explorer's pack and four javelins

### Rage
In battle, you fight with primal ferocity. On your turn, you can enter a rage as a bonus action.

While raging, you gain the following benefits if you aren't wearing heavy armor:

You have advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws.
When you make a melee weapon attack using Strength, you gain a bonus to the damage roll that increases as you gain levels as a barbarian, as shown in the Rage Damage column of the Barbarian table.
You have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.
If you are able to cast spells, you can't cast them or concentrate on them while raging.

Your rage lasts for 1 minute. It ends early if you are knocked unconscious or if your turn ends and you haven't attacked a hostile creature since your last turn or taken damage since then. You can also end your rage on your turn as a bonus action.



Once you have raged the number of times shown for your barbarian level in the Rages column of the Barbarian table, you must finish a long rest before you can rage again.

### Unarmored Defense
While you are not wearing any armor, your armor class equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Constitution modifier. You can use a shield and still gain this benefit.

### Danger Sense
*(2nd level feature)*

At 2nd level, you gain an uncanny sense of when things nearby aren't as they should be, giving you an edge when you dodge away from danger. You have advantage on Dexterity saving throws against effects that you can see, such as traps and spells. To gain this benefit, you can't be blinded, deafened, or incapacitated.

### Reckless Attack
*(2nd level feature)*

Starting at 2nd level, you can throw aside all concern for defense to attack with fierce desperation. When you make your first attack on your turn, you can decide to attack recklessly. Doing so gives you advantage on melee weapon attack rolls using Strength during this turn, but attack rolls against you have advantage until your next turn.

## Features

### Intimidating Strength
*(additional feature for all Barbarians)*

Instead of Rolling using your charisma modifier when attempting to intimidate others, you roll using your strength. Intimidation counts as a strength ability for all Barbarians. 

### Primal Knowledge (Optional)
*(3rd level feature)*

When you reach 3rd level and again at 10th level, you gain proficiency in one skill of your choice from the list of skills available to barbarians at 1st level.

### Ability Score Improvement
When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of yo

*(7th level feature)*

At 7th level, as part of the bonus action you take to enter your rage, you can move up to half your speed.

### Brutal Critical
*(9th level feature)*

Beginning at 9th level, you can roll one additional weapon damage die when determining the extra damage for a critical hit with a melee attack. (Meaning: If your weapons does a total of 2d6, you can roll another 1d6 and add it to the damage)

This increases to two additional dice at 13th level and three additional dice at 17th level.

### Relentless Rage
*(Improved 11th level feature)*

Starting at 11th level, your Rage can keep you fighting despite grievous wounds.

**You ignore the Poisoned condition and the effects of Exhaustion while raging.**

Additionally, if you drop to 0 hit points while you're raging and don't die outright, you can make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. If you succeed, you drop to 1 hit point instead.

Each time you use this feature after the first, the DC increases by 5. When you finish a short or long rest, the DC resets to 10.

### Persistant Rage
*(Improved 15th level feature)*

Beginning at 15th level, your Rage is so fierce that it ends early only if you fall Unconscious or if you choose to end it.

Additionally, **when you fail a saving throw**, you can choose to either spend one use of your rage feature or end your current rage early to re-roll the saving throw and must use the new roll (no action required). You do not spend or end the rage on a failed saving throw.

### Indomitable Might
*(18th level feature)*

Beginning at 18th level, if your total for a Strength check is less than your Strength score, you can use that score in place of the total.

* **Mindless Rage:** Unchanged
* **Intimidating Presence:** *Re-written*
* **Retaliation:** *Re-Written & Re-located*

 
 Specifically, with the *Berserker* Subclass, *Battle Frenzy* & *Frenzied Assault* are optional and replace the Frenzy and Retaliation. You can't just replace one of these features, you always have to replace both.
 
 
### Frenzy
*(rewritten 3rd level)*
*(different ruling of Frenzy, you can take either this option and follow the official leveling, or take the combination of "Battle Frenzy" and "Retaliation")*
 
 
You can go into a frenzy when you rage. If you do so, for the duration of your rage you can make a single melee weapon attack as a bonus action on each of your turns after this one. When your rage ends, you suffer one level of exhaustion.
Additionally, you have the ability to push your body beyond its limits. You recover from Exhaustion faster than others, recovering one level of Exhaustion on short rests. You can also survive for longer without food. The amount of days you can go without food is calculated as follows: 

**Number of Days without food:** 3 + your constution modifier + half your proficiency bonus


### Battle Frenzy
*(Re-written relocated 14th level "Retaliation" feature to 3rd level)*

Starting when you choose this path at 3rd level, while you are raging and take damage from a creature that you can see, you can use your reaction to do one of the following:

* Make a melee weapon attack against that creature if it is within reach. 
* Move up to half your speed, moving only towards that creature.

At 14th level, you can use this reaction even while you're not raging. If you are raging when you use this reaction, you can move up to your full movement speed towards the creature that triggered the reaction, instead of half.

### Mindless Rage
*(6th level feature)*

Beginning at 6th level, you can't be charmed or frightened while raging. If you are charmed or frightened when you enter your rage, the effect is suspended for the duration of the rage.

### Intimidating Presence
*(Reworked 10th level feature)*

Beginning at 10th level, your attacks inflict terror upon your enemies, granting you the following traits:

#### Frightening Strength 

You gain a bonus to Intimidation checks equal to your Strength modifer (minimum of +1).

#### Menacing Blow
**Once per turn when you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack**, you can force it to make a Wisdom saving throw (DC equals 8 + your PB + your Strength modifier) or be Frightened of you until the end of your next turn. Alternatively, you can force a creature to make this saving throw in place of an attack to avoid dealing damage to it.

You can extend the duration of this effect on the frightened creature by using this feature again on it during subsequent turns. The effect ends if the creature ends its turn out of line of sight or more than 60 feet away from you.

If the creature succeeds on its saving throw, you can't use this feature on that creature again for 24 hours.


### Retaliation
*(14th level feature, working with Frenzy)*

Starting at 14th level, when you take damage from a creature that is within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to make a melee weapon attack against that creature.

### Frenzied Assault
*(Re-written and relocated 3rd level "Frenzy" feature moved to 14th level)*

Starting at 14th level, when you take the attack action while you are raging and have advantage on an attack roll against one of the targets, you can forgo the advantage for that roll to make an additional melee weapon attack against that target, as part of the same action. You can do so no more than once per turn.

<h2 id="Path-of-the-Storm-Herald"> Path of the Storm Herald </h2>

**Source:** Xanather's Guide to Everything.
*  **Storm Aura:** *Re-Written*
*  **Storm Soul:** Unchanged
*  **Shielding Storm:** *Replaced*
*  **Raging Storm:** *Re-Written*

### Storm Aura
*(Re-written 3rd level feature)*

Starting at 3rd level, you emanate a stormy, magical aura while you rage. The aura extends 10 feet from you in every direction, but not through total cover. 

Your aura has an effect that activates when you enter your rage, and you can activate the effect again on each of your turns as a bonus action. Choose desert, sea, or tundra. Your aura's effect depends on that chosen environment, as detailed below. 

You can change your environment choice whenever you **finish a short or long rest**. If your aura's effects require a saving throw, the DC equals 8 + your PB + your Constitution modifier.

#### Desert
When this effect is activated, **each creature of your choice** within your aura take fire damage equal to **half your barbarian level (rounded up)** at the end of each of your turns.

#### Sea
When this effect is activated, once on each of your turns you can use a bonus action to choose one other creature you can see in your aura and force them to make a Dexterity saving throw. The target takes **2d6** lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The damage increases when you reach certain levels in this class, increasing to **3d6** at 5th level, **4d6** at 10th level, **5d6** at 15th level, and **6d6** at 20th level.



#### Tundra 
When this effect is activated, each creature of your choice in your aura gains a number of temporary hit points equal to **half your barbarian level (rounded up)**, as icy spirits protect it from suffering.


### Power of the Storm
*(Re-written 10th level feature)*

At 10th level, the power of the storm you channel grows mightier, granting you the following benefits while raging:

* Each creature of your choice has the damage resistance you gained from the Storm Soul feature while the creature is in your Storm Aura.

* As a bonus action, you can gain a flying speed equal to your current walking speed until the end of your turn.

### Raging Storm
*(Re-written 14th level feature)*

At 14th level, you have gained mastery over the storm.

As a bonus action, which can be a part of the same bonus action you use to enter your rage, you can choose to become **immune** to the damage type you gained resistance to from your Storm Soul feature for the duration of your rage. Once you do so, you can't become immune to that damage type again until you finish a long rest.

Furthermore, you gain an additional effect based on the environment you chose for your Storm Aura.

#### Scorching Desert

Immediately after a creature in your aura hits you with an attack, you can use your reaction to force that creature to make a Dexterity saving throw against your Aura save DC. On a failed save, the creature is **blinded** until the start of it's next turn as its vision fills with hot sand.

#### Crashing Sea

**Once per turn** when you hit a creature in your aura with an attack, you can force that creature to make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is knocked prone, as if struck by a wave.

#### Freezing Tundra

Whenever you use a bonus action to activate the effect of your Storm Aura, you can choose one creature you can see in the aura. That creature must succeed on a Strength saving throw against your Aura save DC, or it has its speed reduced to 0 **and can not take reactions** until the start of your next turn, as magical frost covers it.

* **Aspect of the Beast:** *Re-Written*
* **Spirit Walker:** Unchanged
* **Totemic Attunement:** *Re-Written*

### Spirit Totem
*(Re-written and Re-arranged progression)*

At 3rd level, when you adopt this path, you choose a totem spirit and gain its feature. You must make or acquire a physical totem object – an amulet or similar adornment – that incorporates fur or feathers, claws, teeth, or bones of the totem animal. At your option, you also gain minor physical attributes that are reminiscent of your totem spirit. For example, if you have a bear totem spirit, you might be unusually hairy and thick-skinned, or if your totem is the eagle, your eyes turn bright yellow.

Your totem animal might be an animal related to those listed here but more appropriate to your homeland. For example, you could choose a hawk or vulture in place of an eagle.


#### Bear 
While you're raging, any creature within 5 feet of you that's hostile to you has disadvantage on attack rolls against targets other than you or another character with this feature. An enemy is immune to this effect if it can't see or hear you or if it can't be frightened. The spirit of the bear makes you a fearsome protector.

#### Elk 
While you're raging and aren't wearing heavy armor, your walking speed increases by 15 feet. Additionally, **you can't be knocked prone** unless you choose to be. The spirit of the elk makes you extraordinarily sure-footed and swift.

#### Tiger
While you're raging, you can use a **bonus action to grapple a target.** While a target is grappled by you, you can use a bonus action on each of your turns to crush it, **dealing bludgeoning damage equal to 1d4 + your strength modifier.** The spirit of the tiger makes you a deadly predator in close quarters.

#### Wolf

Once per turn while raging, when you damage a creature with a melee attack, you can force the target to make a Strength saving throw (DC equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier). On a failed save, **the creature is knocked prone.** The spirit of the wolf gives you the tenacity to force your enemies to the ground.

*(Re-written 6th level feature)*

At 6th level, you gain a magical benefit based on the totem animal of your choice. You can choose the same animal you selected at 3rd level or a different one.

You attain the swift stride of an elk. Whether mounted or on foot, your travel pace is doubled, as is the travel pace of up to ten companions while they're within 60 feet of you and you're not incapacitated. **Additionally, non-magical difficult terrain doesn’t cost any additional movement for you.**

#### Tiger
You attain the deft and agile movements of a tiger. **You gain a climbing speed equal to your walking speed.** Additionally, you can move stealthily while traveling at a normal pace and so can up to ten companions while they're within 60 feet of you and you're not incapacitated (see chapter 8 "Adventuring" for rules on travel pace).

#### Wolf
You attain the hunting sensibilities of a wolf. **You have advantage on Wisdom (Survival) checks to track creatures you have encountered in the past month.** Additionally, you can track other creatures while traveling at a fast pace (see chapter 8 "Adventuring" for rules on travel pace).

While raging, you have resistance to all damage except psychic.

#### Elk
While raging, **you can move freely through the space of a Large or smaller creature.** Additionally, when you decide to shove a creature, you can **push it up to 10 feet away from you and knock it prone**, dealing bludgeoning damage equal to 1d12 + your Strength modifier.

#### Tiger
While you're raging, if you move at least **10 feet** in a straight line toward a target and hit it with a melee weapon attack, you can use a bonus action to make an additional melee weapon attack against it.

#### Wolf
*(Re-arranged from 3rd level to 14th level)*

While you're raging, any allies within **10 feet** of you have advantage on attack rolls against any creature within 5 feet of you that is hostile to you.

*(Re-written 10th level feature)*

You and a number of creatures equal to your **Constitution modifier (minimum of 1)** of your choice within 60 feet of you that can hear you gain advantage on attack rolls and saving throws until the start of your next turn. 

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a **short rest.**

**Source:** The Sword Coast's Adventuring Guide.
* **Battlerager Armor:** *Replaced*
* **Reckless Abandon:** *Re-written*
* **Battlerager Charge:** *Replaced*
* **Spiked Retribution:** *Replaced*


### Spiked Armor Training 
*(Replaces 3rd level "Battlerager Armor" feature)*

When you choose this path at 3rd level, your training allows you to utilize your armor into a weapon.

You gain proficiency in **smith's tools** in addition to spiked armor, a **variant set of light or medium armor** covered in spikes, barbs or similar features.

You can modify a set of medium or light armor into spiked armor during a long rest using smith’s tools. If the armor is magical, then the damage from your spiked armor becomes magical. 

The spiked variant of a set of armor weighs 5 pounds more and has the following traits when worn with proficiency: 

* **Armor Spikes.** Your unarmed strikes deal piercing damage equal to 1d6 + your Strength modifier on a hit. If you aren't wielding any weapons or a shield when you make the attack roll, the d6 becomes a d8.
* **Retribution.** At the start of each of your turns, you deal 1d4 piercing damage to one creature that has you grappled or is grappled by you.
* **Climbing Hooks.** You have a climbing speed of 30 feet as the armor spikes allow you to hook into vertical surfaces.


### Reckless Abandon
*(Re-written 6th level feature)*

Beginning at 6th level, when you use Reckless Attack while raging, you also gain temporary hit points equal to **half your Barbarian level (rounded up)**. They vanish if any of them are left when your rage ends.


### Barbed Charge
*(Replaces 10th level "Battlerager Charge" feature)*

At 10th level, you have learned how to capitalize on your momentum. While you are raging and aren’t wearing heavy armor, you can dash as a bonus action. 

Additionally, if you move towards a creature and make an unarmed attack while wearing spiked armor, you deal an additional **1d6 piercing damage** for every 10 feet you spend moving in a straight line towards the target of your attack (up to a maximum of 4d6). 

If you reduce a medium or small creature to 0 hit points with this attack, **it is impaled upon your spikes until the start of your next turn, providing you with cover.** A medium creature grants three quarters cover and a small creature grants half cover.

### Piercing Grasp
*(Replaces 14th level "Spiked Retribution" feature)*

At 14th level, if you are raging and take damage from a creature that is within 5 feet of you, **you can use your reaction to make a melee weapon attack against that creature.** If this attack hits while you are wearing spiked armor and you have an open hand, you can choose to **automatically grapple the creature** by hooking your spikes into it.

Furthermore, **you can add your rage damage bonus** to the damage you deal with the retribution trait from your spiked armor.
