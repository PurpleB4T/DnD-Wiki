### Optional: Gathered Swarm
*(Variant 3rd level feature)*

A swarm of intangible nature spirits has bonded itself to you and can assist you in battle. While you're alive, the swarm remains in your space, crawling on you or flying and skittering around you within your space. You determine its appearance.

Once on each of your turns, you can cause the swarm to assist you in one of the following ways, immediately after you hit a creature with an attack:

* The attack's target takes a **1d4 penalty** on the next attack roll it makes before the start of your next turn.
* The attack's target must succeed on a Strength saving throw against your spell save DC or be moved by the swarm up to 15 feet horizontally in a direction of your choice.
* You are moved by the swarm 5 feet horizontally in a direction of your choice.

### Writhing Tide
*(Improved 7th level feature)*

At 7th level, You can condense part of your swarm into a focused mass that lifts you up. As a bonus action, you gain a flying speed of **20 feet** and can hover. This effect lasts for 1 minute or until you are incapacitated. 

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

### Optional: Mighty Swarm
*(Improved 11th level feature)*

At 11th level, your Gathered Swarm grows mightier in the following ways:

* The **attack penalty** of Gathered Swarm increases to **1d6**.
* If a creature fails its saving throw against being moved by Gathered Swarm, you can also cause the swarm to knock the creature prone.
* When you are moved by Gathered Swarm, it gives you half cover until the start of your next turn.
