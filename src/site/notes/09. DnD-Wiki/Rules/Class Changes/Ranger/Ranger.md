### Features

#### Favoured Enemy
*(1st level feature)*

Beginning at 1st level, you have significant experience studying, tracking, hunting, and even talking to a certain type of enemy.

Choose a type of favored enemy: aberrations, beasts, celestials, constructs, dragons, elementals, fey, fiends, giants, monstrosities, oozes, plants, or undead. Alternatively, you can select two races of humanoid (such as gnolls and orcs) as favored enemies.

You have advantage on Wisdom (Survival) checks to track your favored enemies, as well as on Intelligence checks to recall information about them.

When you gain this feature, you also learn one language of your choice that is spoken by your favored enemies, if they speak one at all.

You choose one additional favored enemy, as well as an associated language, at 6th and 14th level. As you gain levels, your choices should reflect the types of monsters you have encountered on your adventures.

#### Favored Foe 
 
*(Re-written 1st level feature)*

You can call on your bond with nature to mark a creature as your favored enemy for a time.

**You know the Hunter's Mark spell**, and Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for it. When you gain the Spellcasting feature at 2nd level, this spell doesnâ€™t count against the number of ranger spells you can prepare.

Additionally, you can cast it **without expending a spell slot** and **without requiring concentration**. When you cast the spell this way, the spell's duration becomes 1 minute or until the marked creature reaches 0 hp.

You regain the ability to cast the spell with this trait when you **finish a short or long rest**.

At 11th level in this class, the damage you deal with Hunter's Mark increases from a d6 to a d8. At 14th level, you can use this feature twice between rests.

#### DEFT EXPLORER
*(1st-level feature, replaces the Natural Explorer feature)*

You are an unsurpassed explorer and survivor, both
in the wilderness and in dealing with others on your
travels. You gain the Canny benefit below, and you
gain an additional benefit below when you reach 6th
level and 10th level in this class.

##### CANNY (1st Level)
 
Choose one of your skill proficiencies. Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you
make that uses the chosen skill.

You can also speak, read, and write two additional
languages of your choice.

##### ROVING (6th Level)

Your walking speed increases by 5, and you gain
a climbing speed and a swimming speed equal to
your walking speed.

\columnbreak

##### TIRELESS (10th Level)

As an action, you can give yourself a number of
temporary hit points equal to 1d8 + your Wisdom
modifier (minimum of 1 temporary hit point). You
can use this action a number of times equal to your
proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses
when you finish a long rest.

In addition, whenever you finish a short rest, your
exhaustion level, if any, is decreased by 1. 


### Spellcasting
*(Re-written 2nd level feature)*

At 2nd level, you have learned to use the magical essence of nature to cast spells, much as a druid does. See chapter 11 of the Player's Handbook for the general rules of spellcasting and the ranger spell list.

#### Preparing and Casting Spells
The Ranger table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells. To cast one of your ranger spells of 1st-level or higher, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all spell slots when you finish a long rest. You **prepare** the list of ranger spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the ranger spell list. When you do so, **choose a number of ranger spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + half your ranger level, rounded down**. The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

For example, if you are a 5th-level ranger, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Wisdom of 14, your list of prepared spells can include four spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell cure wounds, you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn't remove it from your list of prepared spells. You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest.

#### Spellcasting Ability
Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your ranger spells, since your magic draws on your intimate relationship with nature. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a ranger spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

 </font>

 
##### Prepared Spells vs. Known Spells
 As a Spellcaster with prepared spells, the Ranger can ignore the "Spells Known" column of the Ranger table in the Player's Handbook.
 
\pagebreak

### ADDITIONAL RANGER SPELLS

*(2nd-level ranger feature)*

The spells in the following list expand the ranger
spell list in the Player's Handbook. The list is organized by spell level, not character level. Each spell is
in the Player's Handbook, unless it has an asterisk
(a spell in chapter 3). Xanathar's Guide to Everything also offers more spells.


| **1ST LEVEL** | **3RD LEVEL** |
| --- | ---|
| *Entangle* | *Elemental weapon* |
| *Searing smite* | *Meld into stone* |
| | *Revivify* |
| | *Summonfey* |

<br>

| **2ND LEVEL** | **4TH LEVEL** |
| --- | --- |
| *Aid* | *Dominate Beast* |
| *Enhance Ability* | *Summon Elemental* |
| *Gust of Wind* | |
| *Magic Weapon* | |
| *Summon Beast* |

<br>

| **5TH LEVEL** |
| --- |
| *Greater restoration* |

<br>

### FIGHTING STYLE OPTIONS

*(2nd-level ranger feature)*

#### ARCHERY
Archery. You gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls you make with ranged weapons

#### BLIND FIGHTING

You have blindsight with a range of 10 feet. Within
that range, you can effectively see anything that isn't
behind total cover, even if you're blinded or in darkness. Moreover, you can see an invisible creature
within that range, unless the creature successfully
hides from you

#### DEFENSE
Defense. While you are wearing armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC.


#### DRUIDIC WARRIOR

You learn two cantrips of your choice from the druid
spell list. They count as ranger spells for you, and
Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for them. Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace
one of these cantrips with another cantrip from the
druid spell list

\columnbreak

#### DUELING
 When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon.
 
  
  #### THROWN WEAPON FIGHTING
  You can draw a weapon that has the thrown property as part of the attack you make with the weapon.
  
In addition, when you hit with a ranged attack using a thrown weapon, you gain a +2 bonus to the damage roll.

#### TWO WEAPON FIGHTING
 When you engage in two-weapon fighting, you can add your ability modifier to the damage of the second attack.
 
### SPELLCASTING FOCUS
 
*(2nd-level ranger feature)*

You can use a druidic focus as a spellcasting focus
for your ranger spells. A druidic focus might be a
sprig of mistletoe or holly, a wand or rod made of
yew or another special wood, a staff drawn whole
from a living tree, or an object incorporating feathers, fur, bones, and teeth from sacred animals.
 
### PRIMAL AWARENESS
 
*(Re-written 3rd feature)*

At 3rd-level, you can focus your awareness through the interconnections of nature: when you reach certain levels in this class, you can cast the following spells, as shown in the Primal Awareness Spells table. **You always have it prepared**, and it doesn't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day.

#### PRIMAL AWARENESS SPELLS 

<br>

| **Ranger Level** | **Spell** |
| --- | --- |
| 3rd | speak with animals |
| 5th | beast sense |
| 9th | speak with plants |
| 13th | locate creature |
| 17th | commune with nature |


You can cast each of these spells once without
expending a spell slot. Once you cast a spell in
this way, you can't do so again until you finish a
long rest. 

### Ability Score Improvement
When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

\pagebreak

### MARTIAL VERSATILITY

*(4th level feature)*

Whenever you reach a level in this class that grants
the Ability Score Improvement feature, you can replace a fighting style you know with another fighting
style available to rangers. This replacement represents a shift of focus in your martial practice.

### EXTRA ATTACK
*(5th level feature)*

Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

### LAND'S STRIDE
*(8th level feature)*

Starting at 8th level, moving through nonmagical difficult terrain costs you no extra movement. You can also pass through nonmagical plants without being slowed by them and without taking damage from them if they have thorns, spines, or a similar hazard.

In addition, you have advantage on saving throws against plants that are magically created or manipulated to impede movement, such those created by the Entangle spell.

### Hide in Plain Sight
*(10th level feature)*

Starting at 10th level, you can spend 1 minute creating camouflage for yourself. You must have access to fresh mud, dirt, plants, soot, and other naturally occurring materials with which to create your camouflage.

Once you are camouflaged in this way, you can try to hide by pressing yourself up against a solid surface, such as a tree or wall, that is at least as tall and wide as you are. You gain a +10 bonus to Dexterity (Stealth) checks as long as you remain there without moving or taking actions. Once you move or take an action or a reaction, you must camouflage yourself again to gain this benefit.


### NATURE'S VEIL
*(10th level feature)*

You draw on the powers of nature to hide yourself
from view briefly. As a bonus action, you can magically become invisible, along with any equipment
you are wearing or carrying, until the start of your
next turn.

You can use this feature a number of times equal
to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

### VANISH
*(14th level feature)*

Starting at 14th level, you can use the Hide action as a bonus action on your turn. Also, you can't be tracked by nonmagical means, unless you choose to leave a trail.

### FERAL SENSES
*(Re-written 18th level feature)*

Starting at 18th level, your enhanced senses allow you to strike with perfect accuracy. 

**Your attack rolls against creatures within 30 feet of you can not have disadvantage.**

### FOE SLAYER
*(Improved 20th level feature)*

At 20th level, You have become an unparalleled hunter of your enemies.

When you roll initiative, **you immediately regain one use of Favored Foe**.

Additionally, once per turn you can add your Wisdom modifier (minimum of 1) to one attack roll or damage roll you make with a weapon attack against a creature. You can choose to use this feature before or after the roll, but before any effects of the roll are applied


## Beastmaster Companions

The Beast Master in the Player's Handbook forms
a mystical bond with an animal. As an alternative,
a Beast Master can take the feature below to form a
bond with a special primal beast instead. 

### Primal Companion

*3rd-level Beast Master feature, which replaces the
Ranger's Companion feature*

You magically summon a primal beast, which draws
strength from your bond with nature. The beast
is friendly to you and your companions and obeys
your commands. Choose its stat block-Beast of the
Land, Beast of the Sea, or Beast of the Sky-which
uses your proficiency bonus (PB) in several places.
You also determine the kind of animal the beast
is, choosing a kind appropriate for the stat block.
Whatever kind you choose, the beast bears primal
markings, indicating its mystical origin.

In combat, the beast acts during your turn. It can
move and use its reaction on its own, but the only
action it takes is the Dodge action, unless you take
a bonus action on your turn to command it to take
another action. That action can be one in its stat
block or some other action. You can also sacrifice
one of your attacks when you take the Attack action
to command the beast to take the Attack action. If
you are incapacitated, the beast can take any action
of its choice, not just Dodge.

If the beast has died within the last hour, you can
use your action to touch it and expend a spell slot of 1st level or higher. The beast returns to life after 1
minute with all its hit points restored.
When you finish a long rest, you can summon a
different primal beast. The new beast appears in
an unoccupied space within 5 feet of you, and you
choose its stat block and appearance. If you already
have a beast from this feature, it vanishes when
the new beast appears. The beast also vanishes
if you die.
