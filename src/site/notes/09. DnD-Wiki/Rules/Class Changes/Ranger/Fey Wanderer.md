[[09. DnD-Wiki/Rules/Class Changes/Ranger/Ranger\|Back to Ranger]]

**Sources:** Tasha's Cauldron of Everything.
* **Dreadful Strikes:** *Variant added*

### Optional: Dreadful Strikes
*(Variant 3rd level feature)*

You can augment your weapon strikes with mind-scarring magic, drawn from the gloomy hollows of the Feywild. 

When you hit a target of your Favored Foe or Hunter's Mark with a weapon attack, you can deal psychic damage to the target instead of the weapon's normal damage type.

Additionally, the target takes a **d4 penalty** to the next saving throw it makes before the end of your next turn. You can only apply this penalty once per turn. 

At 11th level, the d4 increases to a d6

 
 ##### Favored Foe/Hunter's Mark vs. Subclass damage features
 The Ranger class, even with the Tasha's Cauldron revisions, often muddies the class's playstyle with once per turn damage features gained from subclasses that can be stacked with hunter's mark or favored foe. While this does help the Ranger's damage output, players have found switching back and forth from different kinds and amounts of dice between attacks to be confusing. To help streamline these features, you can consider using these optional extra damage revisions that will focus the source of the ranger's extra damage output on Favored Foe/Hunter's mark instead of arbitrarily adding dice to one attack.
