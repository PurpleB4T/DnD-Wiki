### Hunter Magic
*(Improved 3rd, 5th, 9th, 13th, 17th level feature)*

You learn an additional spell when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown in the Hunter Spells table. Once you gain access to one of these spells, **you always have it prepared**, and it doesn't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. If you gain access to a spell that doesn't appear on the Ranger spell list, the spell is nonetheless a Ranger spell for you.


| Ranger Level  | Spells |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  3rd  | ***Ensnaring Strike*** |
|  5th  | ***Blindness/Deafness*** |
|  9th  | ***Slow*** |
|  13th  | ***Confusion*** |
|  17th  | ***Hold Monster*** |

### Optional: Hunter's Prey
*(Variant 3rd level feature)*

**Colossus Slayer.** Your tenacity can wear down the most potent foes. When you hit a creature that is below its hit point maximum with a weapon attack, you can re-roll any damage die you roll as a part of the attack and choose either result.

### Defensive Tactics
*(Improved 7th level feature)*

At 7th level, you gain one of the following features of your choice.

**Escape the Horde.** Opportunity attacks against you are made with disadvantage and you can pass through an enemy's space as if it were an ally.

**Multiattack Defense.** When a creature hits you with an attack, you gain a +4 bonus to AC against all subsequent attacks made by that creature for the rest of the turn.

**Steel Will.** You have advantage on saving throws against being **charmed or** frightened.
