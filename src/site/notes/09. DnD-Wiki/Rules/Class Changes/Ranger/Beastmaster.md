### Beastmaster Magic
*(Improved 3rd, 5th, 9th, 13th, 17th level feature)*

You learn an additional spell when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown in the Beastmaster Spells table. Once you gain access to one of these spells, **you always have it prepared**, and it doesn't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. If you gain access to a spell that doesn't appear on the Ranger spell list, the spell is nonetheless a Ranger spell for you.

| Ranger Level  | Spells |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  3rd  | ***Heroism*** |
|  5th  | ***Enhance Ability*** |
|  9th  | ***Protection from Energy*** |
|  13th  | ***Death Ward*** |
|  17th  | ***Circle of Power*** |

### Exceptional Training
*(Improved 7th level feature)*

Starting at 7th level, the bond between you and your primal beast has grown, granting you the following benefits: 

* Your primal beast has advantage on saving throws while it is within 60 feet of you and can see you. 

* The attacks of your primal beast **count as magical** for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.

### Beastial Fury
*(Re-written 11th level feature)*

Beginning at 11th level, your primal beast grows ever more fearsome in combat. 

When you command your primal beast to use their Attack action it can make two attacks, instead of one.

### Magical Bond
*(15th level "Share Spells" feature)*

The bond between you and your primal beast has been perfected, allowing you to share magical effects. 

Upon reaching 15th level, when you cast a spell that targets yourself, you can choose for the spell to affect both yourself and your primal beast, as long as it is within 30 feet of you.
