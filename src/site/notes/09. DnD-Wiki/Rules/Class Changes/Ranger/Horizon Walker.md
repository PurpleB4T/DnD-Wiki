**Sources:** Xanather's Guide to Everything.
* **Planar Warrior:** *Variant added*

### Optional: Planar Warrior
*(Variant 3rd level feature)*

At 3rd level, you learn to draw on the energy of the multiverse to augment your attacks. When you hit a target of your **Favored Foe or Hunter's mark** with a weapon attack, you can make all damage you deal with that attack become force damage.
