### Optional: Slayer's Prey
*(Variant 3rd level feature)*

Starting at 3rd level, you can focus your ire on your foe, bypassing it's defenses. Your weapon attacks **ignore resistances and immunities** to non-magical bludgeoning, piercing and slashing damage.

Additionally, once per turn when you hit a target of your Favored Foe or Hunter's Mark with a weapon attack, **it loses one of it's resistances** of your choice until the start of your next turn.


### Optional: Supernatural Defense
*(Variant 7th level feature)*

At 7th level, you gain extra resilience against your prey's assaults on your mind and body. 

Whenever the target of your **Favored Foe or Hunter's Mark** forces you to make a saving throw and whenever you make an ability check to escape that target's grapple, add 1d6 to your roll.


### Optional: Slayer's Counter
*(Variant 15th level feature)*

At 15th level, you gain the ability to counterattack when your prey tries to sabotage you. 

If the target of your **Favored Foe or Hunter's Mark** forces you to make a saving throw, you can use your reaction to make one weapon attack against the quarry. You make this attack immediately before making the saving throw. If your attack hits, your save automatically succeeds, in addition to the attack's normal effects.
