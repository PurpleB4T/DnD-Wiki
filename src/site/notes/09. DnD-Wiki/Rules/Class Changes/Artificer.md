\pagebreak

### Magical Tinkering
At **1st level**, you've learned how to invest a spark of magic into mundane objects. To use this ability, you must have thieves' tools or artisan's tools in hand. You then touch a **Tiny nonmagical object** as an **action** and give it one of the following magical properties of your choice:

The object sheds bright light in a 5-foot radius and dim light for an additional 5 feet.
Whenever tapped by a creature, the object emits a recorded message that can be heard up to 10 feet away. You utter the message when you bestow this property on the object, and the recording can be no more than 6 seconds long.
The object continuously emits your choice of an odor or a nonverbal sound (wind, waves, chirping, or the like). The chosen phenomenon is perceivable up to 10 feet away.
A static visual effect appears on one of the object's surfaces. This effect can be a picture, up to 25 words of text, lines and shapes, or a mixture of these elements, as you like.
The chosen property lasts indefinitely. As an action, you can touch the object and end the property early.

You can bestow magic on multiple objects, touching one object each time you use this feature, though a single object can only bear one property at a time. The maximum number of objects you can affect with this feature at one time is equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of one object). If you try to exceed your maximum, the oldest property immediately ends, and then the new property applies.

### Spellcasting
You've studied the workings of magic and how to cast spells, channeling the magic through objects. To observers, you don't appear to be casting spells in a conventional way; you appear to produce wonders from mundane items and outlandish inventions.

### Tools Required
You produce your artificer spell effects through your tools. You must have a spellcasting focus - specifically thieves' tools or some kind of artisan's tool - in hand when you cast any spell with this Spellcasting feature (meaning the spell has an "M" component when you cast it). You must be proficient with the tool to use it in this way. See the equipment chapter in the Player's Handbook for descriptions of these tools.

After you gain the Infuse Item feature at 2nd level, you can also use any item bearing one of your infusions as a spellcasting focus.

### Cantrips (0-Level Spells)
At 1st level, you know two cantrips of your choice from the artificer spell list. At higher levels, you learn additional artificer cantrips of your choice, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Artificer table.

When you gain a level in this class, you **can replace one of the artificer cantrips** you know with another cantrip from the artificer spell list.

\columnbreak

### Preparing and Casting Spells
The Artificer table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your artificer spells. To cast one of your artificer spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.

You prepare the list of artificer spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the artificer spell list. When you do so, choose a **number of artificer spells equal to your Intelligence modifier + half your artificer level**, rounded down (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

For example, if you are a 5th-level artificer, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With an Intelligence of 14, your list of prepared spells can include four spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell Cure Wounds, you can cast it using a lst-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn't remove it from your list of prepared spells.

You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a **long rest**. Preparing a new list of artificer spells requires time spent tinkering with your spellcasting focuses: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.

### Spellcasting Ability
Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your artificer spells; your understanding of the theory behind magic allows you to wield these spells with superior skill. You use your Intelligence whenever an artificer spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for an artificer spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

**Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier

**Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier

### Ritual Casting
You can cast an artificer spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.

### Infuse Item
At 2nd level, you've gained the ability to imbue mundane items with certain magical infusions, turning those objects into magic items.

#### Infusions Known
When you gain this feature, pick four artificer infusions to learn. You learn additional infusions of your choice when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown in the Infusions Known column of the Artificer table.

Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the artificer infusions you learned with a new one.

\pagebreak

#### Infusing an Item
Whenever you finish a **long rest**, you can touch a nonmagical object and imbue it with one of your artificer infusions, turning it into a magic item. An infusion works on only certain kinds of objects, as specified in the infusion's description. If the item requires attunement, you can attune yourself to it the instant you infuse the item. If you decide to attune to the item later, you must do so using the normal process for attunement (see the attunement rules in the Dungeon Master's Guide).

Your infusion **remains in an item indefinitely**, but when you die, the infusion vanishes after a number of days equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1 day). The **infusion also vanishes if you replace your knowledge** of the infusion.

You can infuse more than one nonmagical object at the end of a long rest; the maximum number of objects appears in the Infused Items column of the Artificer table. You must touch each of the objects, and each of your infusions can be in only one object at a time. Moreover, no object can bear more than one of your infusions at a time. If you try to exceed your maximum number of infusions, the oldest infusion ends, and then the new infusion applies.

If an infusion ends on an item that contains other things, like a bag of holding, its contents harmlessly appear in and around its space.

### Features
#### The Right Tool for the Job
*(3rd level feature)*

At 3rd level, you've learned how to produce exactly the tool you need: with thieves' tools or artisan's tools in hand, you can magically create one set of artisan's tools in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of you. This creation requires 1 hour of uninterrupted work, which can coincide with a short or long rest. Though the product of magic, the tools are nonmagical, and they vanish when you use this feature again.

#### Ability Score Improvement
When you reach 4th level, 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

#### Tool Expertise
*(6th level feature)*

At 6th level, your proficiency bonus is now doubled for any ability check you make that uses your proficiency with a tool.

#### Flash of Genius
*(7th level feature)*

At 7th level, you've gained the ability to come up with solutions under pressure. When you or another creature you can see within 30 feet of you makes an ability check or a saving throw, you can use your reaction to add your Intelligence modifier to the roll.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

\columnbreak
#### Magic Item Adept
*(10th level feature)*

When you reach 10th level, you achieve a profound understanding of how to use and make magic items:

You can attune to up to four magic items at once.
If you craft a magic item with a rarity of common or uncommon, it takes you a quarter of the normal time, and it costs you half as much of the usual gold.
Spell-Storing Item
At 11th level, you can now store a spell in an object. Whenever you finish a long rest, you can touch one simple or martial weapon or one item that you can use as a spellcasting focus, and you store a spell in it, choosing a 1st- or 2nd-level spell from the artificer spell list that requires 1 action to cast (you needn't have it prepared).

While holding the object, a creature can take an action to produce the spell's effect from it, using your spellcasting ability modifier. If the spell requires concentration, the creature must concentrate. The spell stays in the object until it's been used a number of times equal to twice your Intelligence modifier (minimum of twice) or until you use this feature again to store a spell in an object.

#### Magic Item Savant
*(14th level feature)*

At 14th level, your skill with magic items deepens more:

You can attune to up to five magic items at once.
You ignore all class, race, spell and level requirements on attuning to or using a magic item.
Magic Item Master
Starting at 18th level, you can attune up to six magic items at once.

#### Soul of Artifice
*(20th level feature)*

At 20th level, you develop a mystical connection to your magic items, which you can draw on for protection:

You gain a +1 bonus to all saving throws per magic item you are currently attuned to.
If you're reduced to 0 hit points but not killed out-right, you can use your reaction to end one of your artificer infusions, causing you to drop to 1 hit point instead of 0.

# Subclasses 
<h2 id="Alchemist"> Alchemist </h2>

**Source:** Tasha's Cauldron of Everything.
* **Tool Proficiency:** *Improved*
* **Alchemical Reagent's Pouch:** *Added*
* **Instant Reactions:** *Added*
* **Alchemist Spells:** *Unchanged*
* **Alchemical Infusions:** *Replaces Experimental Elixir*
* **Empowered Alchemy:** *Replaces Alchemical Savant*
* **Restorative Reagents:** *Unchanged*
* **Chemical Mastery:** *Unchanged*

### Tool Proficiency (improved)
*(3rd level feature)*

When you adopt this specialization at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with alchemist's supplies. If you already have this proficiency, you gain proficiency with one other type of artisan's tools of your choice.
**Your knowledge of alchemy gives you a natural affinity for brewing potions. Creating a potion through normal crafting takes you only half the time and cost it would normally take.**

### Alchemical Reagent's Pouch (Added)
*(3rd level feature)*

At 3rd  level, you've acquired a pouch of useful basic reagents, much as a wizard might carry a component pouch. You've tucked away things that will come in handy, and can retrieve them as part of using an ability that might require them. As long as you have this pouch on, you can do alchemy. This pouch is considered as alchemy supplies for the purposes of crafting.
If you lose your reagent pouch, you can spend 50 gold pieces to reacquire the various stocks you need, or spend 1 full day gathering them from a natural environment without expense.

### Instant Reactions (Added)
*(3rd level feature)*

At 3rd level, you know how to get instant reactions to occur without the niceties of grinding, simmering and brewing required for more refined concoctions.
Moreover, you know enough ways to do this that with just a few standard supplies, you can get these results out of a wide range of things you can gather in almost any locale and a pinch from your reagent pouch.
You know the following instant reactions.
#### Alchemical Fire. 
As an action you can produce a reaction causing a searing flame. At a point within 15 feet, you can toss a quick combination of things that will cause searing fire to flare up in a 5 foot radius. Creatures in that area have to make a dexterity saving throw, or take 1d8 fire damage.
The damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th level (2d8), 11th level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8).
#### Poisonous Gas. 
As an action you can produce a reaction causing noxious fumes. At a point within 15 feet, you can toss a quick combination of things that will cause a whiff of poisonous gas to erupt spreading to a radius of 5 feet. Creatures in that area have to make a constitution saving throw, or take 1d4 poison damage and become poisoned until the end of their next turn.
The damage increases by 1d4 when you reach 5th level (2d4), 11th level (3d4), and 17th level (4d4).
#### Healing Draught. 
As a bonus action, you can produce a combination that will provide potent magical healing. Immediately after creating the draught, you can use your action to consume it or give it a creature within 5 feet. An adjacent creature can use their reaction to drink it if given it. If an adjacent creature is incapacitated and unconscious, you can use your action to feed it to them. A creature who drinks this draught regains 1d8 health. A creature can benefit from a number of these healing draughts equal to their constitution modifier (minimum 1), after which they provide no additional benefit until they complete a long rest.
The healing increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th level (2d8), 11th level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8).

\pagebreak
### Alchemist Spells (Unchanged)
*(3rd level feature)*

Starting at 3rd level, you always have certain spells prepared after you reach particular levels in this class, as shown in the Alchemist Spells table. These spells count as artificer spells for you, but they don’t count against the number of artificer spells you prepare.

| Artificer Level | Alchemist Spells |
| - | - |
| 3rd | Healing Word, Ray of Sickness |
| 5th | Flaming Sphere, Melf's Acid Arrow |
| 9th | Gaseous Form, Mass Healing Word |
| 13th | Blight, Death Ward |
| 17th | Cloudkill, Raise Dead |



### Alchemical Infusions (Replaces Experimental Elixir)
*(3rd level feature)*

At 3rd level, you have found a way to skip most of the brewing process for alchemically creating potent magical effects by directly infusing the potion with your own magic. Creating a potion using this feature takes you an hour. You have to have an empty vial available.

You may choose one of the following spells and can use a spell slot to cast it, or team up with another spellcaster and turn one of their spells into a potion.

Spell Level |Infusion Spells
 --- | ---
1st | cure wounds, entangle, grease
2nd |barkskin, shatter, lesser restoration
3rd |blink, water breathing
4th |stoneskin, confusion
5th |cloudkill, skill empowerment

When you cast the spell in this way, the spell does not take effect immediately, but is infused into the potion. If the spell grants an effect or restores health, the creature will gain the effect of the spell when the potion is consumed.



#### Team Potions.
You can team up with other spellcasters to create potions of spells not listed in the previous table. The following rules apply for this:

* You can easily bottle a spell of a level up to your highest spell level. Infusing a potion with a higher level spell than available requires a successful check using the Alchemists tools of 20 + the levels above
*eg. bottling Haste (as a 3rd level spell) at an 8th level Alchemist requires a check of 21*
* Spells can only be cast at base level.
* Extra modifiers of spellcaster do not apply.
* Cast spells have to target only one creature or an area. *So Scorching Ray is not applicable while Witch Bolt or Fireball are.*
* Hitting an enemy creature with an attack-roll based spell in the potion still requires a normal attack against its AC. The DC for a saving throw is the Alchemists DC. While the attack roll is handled as throwing the potion (meaning a Dexterity based attack )
* Any material components need to be used in creation (specific materials are consumed; spells with specific material components, that can't be ignored using a focus and are not consumed aren't applicable)
* Moving spells like Spiritual Weapon or Flaming Sphere are not applicable.
* The potion doesn't lose its effect or potency after a specific time, but lasts until consumed.
* Affecting a willing creature: The person throwing the potion must make a Dex-Check for a DC of 10 + cover mod (half cover/3quarter cover) (+ 2 for difficult terrain)

If the spell has an area of effect, that area of effect takes place when the vial is broken, with the effect centered on where the vial breaks. As an action, you or another creature can either consume the vial, or throw it up to 30 feet where it shatters on impact.

You can create a number of potions up to half your PB (rounded down), each day.

### Empowered Alchemy (Replaces Alchemical Savant)
*(5th level feature)*

Starting at 5th level, when you deal damage or restore health with an instant reaction or alchemical infusion, you can add your intelligence modifier to the damage dealt or health restored.

### Restorative Reagents (Unchanged)
*(9th level feature)*

Starting at 9th level, you can incorporate restorative reagents into some of your works:

- Whenever a creature **drinks an alchemical infusion** you created, the creature gains temporary hit points equal to 2d6 + your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1 temporary hit point).
- You can cast Lesser Restoration without expending a spell slot and without preparing the spell, provided you use alchemist's supplies as the spellcasting focus. You can do so a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.
 

### Chemical Mastery (Unchanged)
By 15th level, you have been exposed to so many chemicals that they pose little risk to you, and you can use them to quickly end certain ailments:

- You gain resistance to acid damage and poison damage, and you are now immune to the poisoned condition.
- You can cast Greater Restoration and Heal without expending a spell slot, without preparing the spell, and without providing the material component, provided you use alchemist’s supplies as the spellcasting focus. Once you cast either spell with this feature, you can't cast that spell with it again until you finish a long rest.

\pagebreak
### Added Infusions:
A few Infusion are added for Alchemists. They count against the number of your known infusions.
#### Aroma Therapies.
You expand your alchemical knowledge to be able to produce incense and simmering reagents that grant effects to those that inhale their fumes. If creatures spend a long rest inhaling fumes from a concoction you devise with this feature, creatures regain all of their expended hit dice, instead of only recovering half, and are cured of any non-magical diseases they are suffering from.


#### Adrenaline Serum. 
**Prerequisite: 9th level Artificer.**

You create a potent serum. As a bonus action on your turn, you can consume this serum, granting you the effects of Haste and Heroism for a number of rounds equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum 1). These effects do not require concentration, but you still suffer the normal effects of the Haste spell ending when it ends. You can use this a number of times equal to your constitution modifier (minimum 1) before you must take a long rest to gain the effects from the serum again.
Another creature can take this dose, but they must pass a Constitution saving throw equal to your spell save to gain the effects, and become poisoned on a failed save.
 
#### Delivery Mechanism.
You modify the stability of your reagents and develop a better delivery mechanism. You can target a point within 30 feet for your instant reactions that target a point. The additional precision allows you to better target the effects, allowing creatures of your choice within the target area to automatically pass their dexterity saving throw against your effects.

#### Explosive Reaction.
You formulate a new instant reaction, a devastating minor explosion. Targeting a point within 15 feet, you cause an explosion. Creatures within 10 feet of the target point must make a constitution saving throw, or take 1d10 thunder damage from the shockwave of the explosion.
The damage increases by 1d10 when you reach 5th level (4d10), 11th level (4d10), and 17th level (4d10).

#### Greater Adrenaline Shot. 
**Prerequisite: Adrenaline Serum.**

You upgrade your adrenaline shot to produce even more extreme and magical effects in the creature it affects. The adrenaline shot also adds the effect of Tenser's Transformation when you consume it. This effect only takes place if you are the one consuming the serum. You do not suffer the effects of Tenser's Transformation wearing off when the serum effect ends.
Inoculations.
You and up to five allies of your choice are inoculated against the poisonous effects you can produce that require a constitution saving throw (such as the poisonous gas instant reaction or the cloudkill infusion). Additionally, you gain resistance to poison damage.

#### Infusion Stone. 
**Prerequisite: 9th level Artificer.**

You use the secrets of Alchemy to create an Infusion Stone. You can use this stone in the process of infusing potions in place of a spell slot of equal or higher level than the highest level spell slot you can cast.
You can use this stone to replace a spell slot for an infusion once. It regains this charge after you complete a long rest.

#### Mana Potion.
During a short rest, you can create a mana potion. A mana potion loses its potency if it is not consumed within 1 minute. As an action, a creature can consume a mana potion to restore a spell slot of its choice, up to third level.



#### Poisoner's Proficiency. 
You delve into the secrets of the darkest secrets of herblore, learning the potent secrets of poison. During a long rest, you can create one of the following poisons. You can also nullify a poisons effect with a successfull check using your tools.
##### Contact poison. 
You can apply this to a weapon or up to ten pieces of ammunition, lasting until the end of your next long rest. That weapon deals an additional 1d4 poison damage to targets it strikes.
##### Ingested poison. 
This is a simple flavorless powder. If a creature consumes a full dose of this poison before the end of your next long rest, after one minute has passed they must make a Constitution saving throw with disadvantage against your spell save DC or take a number of d10 equal to your Artificer level in poison damage, and become poisoned until they complete a long rest.

#### Secrets of Enhancement.
You learn the secrets of infusing powerful enhancements into your Alchemical Infusions. You can add the following spells to your list of available spells for alchemical infusions:

Spell Level | Infusion Spells
---|---
1st |heroism
2nd |enlarge/reduce
3rd |haste

\pagebreak
#### Secrets of Fire.
You learn the secrets of infusing fire into your Alchemical Infusions. You can add the following spells to your list of available spells for alchemical infusions:

Spell Level |Infusion Spells
 --- | ---
1st |faerie fire
2nd |dragon's breath
3rd |fireball


#### Secrets of Frost.
You learn the secrets of infusing fire into your Alchemical Infusions. You can add the following spells to your list of available spells for alchemical infusions:

Spell Level |Infusion Spells
 --- | ---
1st |armor of agathys
2nd |snilloc's snowball swarm
3rd |ice storm
