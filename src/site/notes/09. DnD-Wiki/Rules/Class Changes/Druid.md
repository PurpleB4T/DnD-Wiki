# Main
## Base Class Features

**Source:** Player's Handbook.
* **Natural Shifter:** *Added*

### Natural Shifter
*(Added 12th level feature)*

Starting at 12th level, your connection to nature allows you to effortlessly adopt the forms of its simplest denizens. 

You can transform into a beast of CR 0 at will without expending a use of your Wildshape feature for as long as you can maintain concentration (as if you were concentrating on a spell). All the other rules for Wildshape still apply.

**Source:** Xanather's Guide to Everything.
* **Circle Spells:** *Added*
* **Balm of the Summer Court:** Unchanged
* **Hearth of Moonlight and Shadow:** Unchanged
* **Hidden Paths:** Unchanged
* **Walker in Dreams:** *Re-Written*

### Circle Spells
*(Added 2nd, 3rd, 5th, 7th, and 9th level feature)*

When you join this circle at 2nd level, your connection to the Feywild grants you access to some spells when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown on the Circle of Dreams Spells table.

Once you gain access to one of these spells, you always have it prepared, and it doesn't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. If you gain access to a spell that doesn't appear on the Druid Spell List, the spell is nonetheless a druid spell for you.

| Druid Level  | Spells |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  2nd  | ***Sleep, Sanctuary*** |
|  3rd  | ***Calm Emotions, Mirror Image*** |
|  5th  | ***Catnap, Intellect Fortress*** |
|  7th  | ***Dimension Door, Private Sanctum*** |
|  9th  | ***Dawn, Dispel Evil and Good*** |

### Walker in Dreams
*(Re-written 14th level feature)*

At 14th level, the magic of the Feywild grants you the ability to travel mentally or physically through dreamlands. When you finish a short rest, you can cast one of the following spells, without expending a spell slot or requiring material components: Dream (with you as the messenger), Scrying, or Teleportation circle.

This use of the teleportation circle spell is special. Rather than opening a portal to a permanent teleportation circle, **you magically mark a surface on which you are standing that your teleportation circle will bring you to anytime you decide to cast it**. Once you teleport to the marked location, the mark vanishes. If the mark isn't on the same plane as you, the spell fails. 

Once you mark a location, you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest. If you mark another location while you already have a mark, the previous mark vanishes.

### Environment Attunment
*(Re-written 2nd level "Circle Spells" feature)*

At 2nd level, you are infused with the ability to cast certain spells based on your environment. These spells are listed in the Environment Spells table. When you finish a long rest, you can attune to one of the following options based on the environment around: arctic, cave, coast, desert, forest, grassland, mountain, or swamp.

While you are attuned to that environment you gain access to the spells in the corresponding column of the Environment Spells table below. They count as druid spells for you and you always have them prepared, but they don't count against the total number of druid spells you can prepare each day.

\pagebreak

### Nature's Ward
*(Re-written 10th level feature)*

When you reach 10th level, you are immune to poison and disease. Additionally, when you finish a short or long rest, choose one of the following damage types: acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder. You gain resistance to that type of damage until the end of your next short or long rest.

### Nature's Sanctuary
*(Improved 14th level feature)*

When you reach 14th level, your connection to nature grants allow you to empower your defense with enchanting magic. 

As a bonus action, you can grant yourself a number of **temporary hits points equal to your druid level**. These temporary hit-points carry over to your Wildshape forms. 

If a creature attacks you while you have these temporary hit points, that creature must make a Wisdom saving throw against your druid spell save DC. A creature that can't be charmed automatically succeeds.

On a failed save, the creature must choose a different target, or the attack automatically misses. On a successful save, the creature is immune to this effect for 24 hours. The creature is aware of this effect before it makes its attack against you. 

Once you this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

* **Elemental Wild Shape:** *Re-Written*
* **Thousand Forms:** Unchanged

### Circle Forms 
*(Re-written 2nd level feature)*

The rites of your circle grant you the ability to transform into more dangerous animal forms. 

Starting at 2nd level, the max challenge rating of beast you can wild shape into is **double** the number specified in the Max CR column of the Beast Shapes table. You must still abide by the other limitations of Wild Shape. 

For example, at 2nd level you can transform into any beast that has a challenge rating of 1/2 or lower that doesn't have a flying or swimming speed.

Starting at 6th level, you can transform into a beast with a challenge rating as high as your druid level divided by 3, rounded down.

\columnbreak

### Greater Wild Shape
*(Replaces 6th level Primal Strike feature)*

Starting at 6th level, your attacks in beast form count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.

Additionally, you can expend both uses of your Wild Shape to transform into a beast with a challenge rating as high as half your druid level (rounded down).

Once you use your Wild Shape this way, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest.

### Elemental Wild Shape
*(Re-written 10th level feature)*

At 10th level, when you use your Greater Wild Shape feature, you can choose to transform into an air, earth, fire, or water elemental instead.

### Thousand Forms
*(Re-written 14th level feature)*

By 14th level, you have learned to use magic to alter your physical form in more subtle ways. You can cast the alter self spell at will and can cast it without providing a verbal component. You can cast the spell this way while in Wild Shape.

### Spirit Totem
*(Re-written 2nd level feature)*

Starting at 2nd level, you gain the ability to call forth nature spirits and use them to influence the world around you.

As a bonus action, **you can expend one use of your Wild Shape feature** to magically summon an incorporeal spirit, **rather than assuming a beast form**. 

Choose to a point you can see within 60 feet of you. The spirit creates an aura in a 30-foot radius around that point. It counts as neither a creature nor an object, though it has the spectral appearance of the creature it represents. As a bonus action, you can move the spirit up to 60 feet to a point you can see.

The spirit persists for 1 minute. Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest. The effect of the spirit’s aura depends on the type of spirit you summon from the options below.

\pagebreak

**Bear Spirit**. The bear spirit grants you and your allies its might and endurance. Each creature of your choice in the aura when the spirit appears gains temporary hit points equal to 5 + your druid level. In addition, you and your allies gain advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws while in the aura.

**Hawk Spirit**. The hawk spirit is a consummate hunter, aiding you and your allies with its keen sight. When a creature makes an attack roll against a target in the spirit’s aura, you can use your reaction to grant advantage to that attack roll. In addition, you and your allies have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks while in the aura.

**Unicorn Spirit**. The unicorn spirit lends its protection to those nearby. You and your allies gain advantage on all ability checks made to detect creatures in the spirit’s aura. In addition, if you cast a spell using a spell slot that restores hit points to any creature inside or outside the aura, each creature of your choice in the aura also regains hit points equal to your druid level.
