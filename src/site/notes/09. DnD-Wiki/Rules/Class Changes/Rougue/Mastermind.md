[[09. DnD-Wiki/Rules/Class Changes/Rougue/Rogue\|Back to Rogue]]

**Your focus is on people and on the influence and secrets they have. Many spies, courtiers, and schemers follow this archetype, leading lives of intrigue. Words are your weapons as often as knives or poison, and secrets and favors are some of your favorite treasures.**

* **Master of Intrigue:** Unchanged
* **Master of Tactics:** *Improved*
* **Insightful Manipulator:** Unchanged
* **Misdirection:** *Improved*
* **Soul of Deceit:** *Improved*

### Master of Intrigue
When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with the disguise kit, the forgery kit, and one gaming set of your choice. You also learn two languages of your choice.

Additionally, you can unerringly mimic the speech patterns and accent of a creature that you hear speak for at least 1 minute, enabling you to pass yourself off as a native speaker of a particular land, provided that you know the language.

### Master of Tactics
*(Improved 3rd level feature)*

Starting at 3rd level, your cunning allows you to skillfully direct your allies. As a **bonus action**, choose one creature that you can see within 60 feet of you. If it can hear you, you grant it one of the following benefits until the end of its next turn:

* **Assist.** The target receives the benefit of the **help** action, which can be used to aid it in attacking a creature within 60 feet of you that you can see instead of 5 feet.

* **Retreat.** The target receives the benefit of the **disengage** action.

### Insightful Manipulator

Starting at 9th level, if you spend at least 1 minute observing or interacting with another creature outside combat, you can learn certain information about its capabilities compared to your own. The DM tells you if the creature is your equal, superior, or inferior in regard to two of the following characteristics of your choice:

- Intelligence score
- Wisdom score
- Charisma score
- Class levels (if any)

At the DM's option, you might also realize you know a piece of the creature's history or one of its personality traits, if it has any.

### Master of Misdirection
*(Re-written 13th level feature)*

Starting at 13th level, your quick wit allows you to anticipate attacks, allowing you to redirect others into or out of harm's way. 

**Warn.** When an ally within 60 feet of you is attacked or is forced to make a Dexterity saving throw, you can use your reaction to grant it the benefits of the dodge action for that instance. A creature must be able to see or hear you to gain this benefit.

**Redirect.** When you are targeted by an attack while a creature within 5 feet of you is granting you cover against that attack, you can use your reaction to have the attack target that creature instead of you.

### Soul of Deceit
*(Re-written 17th level feature)*

Starting at 17th level, your words gain an almost unnatural power to mislead and confuse others. 

No matter what you say, magic that would determine if you are telling the truth indicates you are being truthful if you so choose, and you can't be compelled to tell the truth by magic. 

Additionally, as an action, you can make a **Charisma (Deception) check** contested by a creature's Wisdom (Insight) check. The creature must be able to hear you, and the two of you must share a language. 

If you succeed on the check and the creature is hostile to you, it has **disadvantage** on attack rolls against you and can't make opportunity attacks against you for 1 minute or until you and the target are more than 60 feet apart. 

If you succeed on the check and the creature isn't hostile to you, the creature has **disadvantage** on Wisdom (Perception) checks and Wisdom (Insight) checks for 1 minute. This effect ends immediately if you or your companions do anything harmful to it.

If your check fails, the target can't be deceived by you in this way for 24 hours.
