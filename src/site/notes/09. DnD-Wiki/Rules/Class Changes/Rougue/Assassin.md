**You focus your training on the grim art of death. Those who adhere to this archetype are diverse: hired killers, spies, bounty hunters, and even specially anointed priests trained to exterminate the enemies of their deity. Stealth, poison, and disguise help you eliminate your foes with deadly efficiency.**

* **Bonus Proficiencies:** Unchanged
* **Assassinate:** Unchanged
* **Infiltration Expertise:** *Replaced*
* **Impostor:** *Replaced*
* **Death Strike:** Unchanged

### Bonus Proficiencies
When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with the disguise kit and the poisoner's kit.

### Assassinate
Starting at 3rd level, you are at your deadliest when you get the drop on your enemies. You have advantage on attack rolls against any creature that hasn't taken a turn in the combat yet. In addition, any hit you score against a creature that is surprised is a critical hit.

### Imposter's Subterfuge
*(Replaces 9th level "Infiltration Expertise" feature)*

At 9th level, you become an unerring expert in impersonation and infiltration, granting you the following benefits:

* Over the course of an hour, you can craft a disguise identical to a humanoid creature that you have seen. To do so you must have a disguise kit and must be observing the creature as you craft the disguise or have observed the creature for at least one hour. To see through your disguise, a creature must succeed on an Intelligence (Investigation) or a Wisdom (Insight) check, contested by your Charisma (Deception) check.
* You have advantage on Charisma (Deception) checks to pretend to be another humanoid creature while you have assumed a disguise.
* You can easily conceal up to two light weapons within each of your disguises and creatures have disadvantage on Intelligence (Investigation) checks to find them as long as there is enough material to cover them. 
* While wearing an appropriate disguise, you benefit as if you were hidden on weapon attacks against creatures deceived by your disguise.


### Assassin's Venom
*(Replaces 13th level "Imposter" feature)*

At 13th level, you have become an expert in crafting and handling poisons, granting you the following benefits:

* The DC to resist Poisons you craft or inflict through injury is now 8 + your PB + your Intelligence modifier, unless the DC is already higher.
*  You can apply an injury poison to your weapon as a bonus action.
*  When you administer an injury poison while hidden, the target has disadvantage on the first saving throw against it. 
*  You can choose for the poisons you craft to deal necrotic damage instead of poison damage.

### Death Strike
Starting at 17th level, you become a master of instant death. When you attack and hit a creature that is surprised, it must make a Constitution saving throw (DC 8 + your Dexterity modifier + your proficiency bonus). On a failed save, double the damage of your attack against the creature.
