* **Channel Divinity: Cloak of Shadows:** *Improved*

### Channel Divinity: Invoke Duplicity
*(Clarified 2nd level feature)*

Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to create an illusory duplicate of yourself.

As an action, you create a perfect illusion of yourself that lasts for 1 minute, or until you lose your concentration (as if you were concentrating on a spell). The illusion appears in an unoccupied space that you can see within 30 feet of you. As a bonus action on your turn, you can move the illusion up to 30 feet to a space you can see, but it must remain within 120 feet of you.

For the duration, **you can speak through your illusion** or cast spells as though you were in the illusion's space, but you must use your own senses. Additionally, when both you and your illusion are within 5 feet of a creature that can see the illusion, you have advantage on attack rolls against that creature, given how distracting the illusion is to the target.

### Channel Divinity: Cloak of Shadows
*(Improved 6th level feature)*

Starting at 6th level, you can use your Channel Divinity to vanish. As an action, you become invisible for **1 minute**. You become visible if you attack or cast a spell.

### Guided Strike
*(Re-written 2nd level feature changed to 1st level)*

From 1st level, your god delivers bolts of inspiration to you and your allies while you are engaged in battle. 

When you or a creature within 30 feet of you makes an attack roll, you can use your reaction to grant a bonus to the attack roll equal to **your wisdom modifier**. You make this choice after you see the roll, but before the DM says whether the attack hits or misses.

You can use this feature **a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus**. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

### Channel Divinity: War God's Blessing
*(Rewritten 6th level feature changed to 2nd level)*

Starting at 2nd level, as a bonus action, you present your holy symbol and choose a creature you can see within 30 feet (this can include yourself). 

The target gains **temporary hit points** equal to 1d8 + your cleric level. While a creature has temporary hit points granted by your Channel Divinity, **weapon attacks made against it have disadvantage**. 

The creature loses any remaining temporary hit points after 1 minute.

### War Priest
*(Re-written 1st level feature changed to 6th level)*

Starting at 6th level, when you miss with a weapon or spell attack, you can use your bonus action to make an additional weapon attack.

### Divine Strike
*(Improved 8th level feature)*

At 8th level, you gain the ability to infuse your weapon strikes with divine energy. Your weapon attacks count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage. 

Additionally, once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can cause the attack to deal an extra 1d8 damage of the same type dealt by the weapon to the target. 

When you reach 14th level, the extra damage increases to 2d8.



### Avatar of Battle
*(Improved 17th level feature)*

At 17th level, you gain resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from non-magical weapons.

Additionally, when a creature other than yourself gains the benefit of your guided strike feature, they deal an additional 2d8 radiant damage if they hit.

### Channel Divinity: Twilight Sanctuary
*(Nerfed 2nd level feature)*

At 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to refresh your allies with soothing twilight.

As an action, you present your holy symbol, and a sphere of twilight emanates from you. The sphere is centered on you, has a 30-foot radius, and is filled with dim light. The sphere moves with you, and it lasts for 1 minute or until you are incapacitated or die. Whenever a creature (including you) ends its turn in the sphere, **you can use your reaction** to grant that creature one of these benefits:
* You grant it temporary hit points equal to 1d6 plus **half your cleric level**.
* You end one effect on it causing it to be charmed or frightened.

### Emboldening Bond
*(Reworked and nerfed 1st level feature)*

Starting at 1st level, you can forge an empowering bond among people who are at peace with one another. 

As an action, you choose a number of willing creatures within 30 feet of you (this can include yourself) equal to your **wisdom modifier**. You create a magical bond among them for **10 minutes** or until you use this feature again. 

Once per round while any bonded creature is within 30 feet of another, the creature can re-roll a failed ability check or saving throw. Once a creature re-rolls it must accept the new roll.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.
