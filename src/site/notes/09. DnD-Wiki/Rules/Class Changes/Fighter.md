* **Action Surge:** *Re-arranged progression*
* **Extra Attack:** *Re-arranged progression*
* **Superior Technique:** *Re-written into Class Feature*
* **Indomitable:** *Improved*
* **Fighting Style Mastery:** *Added*

### Fighting Style
*(Improved 1st level feature)*

You adopt a particular style of fighting as your specialty. You learn one fighting style of your choice. You can't take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.

#### Two-Weapon Fighting
When you engage in two-weapon fighting, you can add your ability modifier to the damage of the off-hand attack.

Moreover, you can make your attack with an off-hand weapon as a part of the attack action **instead of a bonus action**. You can still only attack with an off-hand weapon once per turn.

### Second Wind
*(Improved 1st level feature)*

You have a limited well of stamina that you can draw on to protect yourself from harm. 

On your turn, you can use a bonus action to regain hit points equal to 1d10 + your fighter level. Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again.

**Starting at 9th level**, when you use your Second Wind, your exhaustion level, if any, is decreased by 1 and any poison affecting you is immediately neutralized.

### Superior Techniques
*(Changed to Additional 5th level feature)*

At 5th level, you learn maneuvers that are fueled by special dice called superiority dice.

**Maneuvers.** You learn two maneuvers of your choice from among those available to the Battle Master archetype. You can use only one maneuver per attack. When you gain a level in this class, you can replace one maneuver you know for another maneuver you don't know from the list of Battle Master maneuvers.

**Superiority Dice.** You gain two superiority dice, which are d6s (these dice are added to any superiority dice you may have). These dice are used to fuel your maneuvers. Once a superiority die is used, it is expended until you finish a short or long rest, in which you regain all expended superiority dice.

**Saving Throws.** Some of your maneuvers require your target to make a saving throw to resist the maneuver's effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:

**Maneuver save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength or Dexterity modifier (your choice)

### Action Surge
*(Re-arranged progression)*

Starting at 2nd level, you can push yourself beyond your normal limits for a moment. On your turn, you can take one additional action.

Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again. Starting at **20th level**, you can use this feature twice between rests, but only once on the same turn.

### Extra Attack
*(Re-arranged progression)*

Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

The number of attacks increases to three when you reach 11th level in this class and to four when you reach **17th level** in this class.

### Indomitable
*(Improved 9th level feature)*

Beginning at 9th level, **when you fail a saving throw, you can choose to treat the d20 roll as a 20 instead.** Once you have used this feature to turn a failed save into a success, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

You gain additional uses of this feature between long rests at higher levels, gaining two uses At 13th level, and three uses at 17th level.

### Fighting Style Mastery
*(Added 20th level feature)*

At 20th level, you have achieved unrivaled prowess in your chosen form of combat. You gain additional benefits associated with a Fighting Style you choose at 1st level.

#### Adamant Protection
**Prequisite Fighting Style: Protection**

You defend your allies without fail. While you are not incapacitated, allied creatures gain your shield's AC bonus so long as they are within 5 feet of you. You must be wielding a shield for your allies to gain this benefit.

#### Blind Awareness
**Prequisite Fighting Style: Blind Fighting**

Even without vision, nothing can evade your sight. Your blindsight extends to a radius of 30 feet, allowing you to effectively see everything withing range that's not behind full cover unless a creature successfully hides from you. 

Moreover, your attacks against creatures within this range can not have disadvantage.

\pagebreak
#### Dueling Mastery
**Prequisite Fighting Style: Dueling**

When you fight, you fight to win. Once per turn, when you miss with an attack against a creature within reach while holding a weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you can make an additional attack with that weapon against that creature.



#### Great Weapon Brutality
**Prequisite Fighting Style: Great Weapon Fighting**

You strike with devastating power. Once per turn when you hit with a melee weapon that you are wielding in two hands, you can roll one additional weapon damage die. The weapon must have the two-handed or versatile property for you to gain this benefit.

#### Peerless Archery
**Prequisite Fighting Style: Archery**

Your accuracy knows no bounds. Once per turn when you make a ranged weapon attack against a target within your normal range, you can choose to grant yourself advantage on the attack roll. You can make this choice after you make the attack roll and see the result, but before the DM says whether the attack hits or misses.

#### Unarmed Supremacy
**Prequisite Fighting Style: Unarmed Fighting**

In the absence of weapons, you have honed your body into one of incredible might. 

The damage die of your unarmed strikes increase to a d10 (or a d12 if you aren't wielding any weapons or a shield) and the damage you deal to a creature grappled by you increases to a d8 each turn. 

Additionally, you have advantage on Strength (Athletics) checks to grapple or shove and you can grapple or shove creatures one size larger than normal.

#### Unbreakable Defense
**Prequisite Fighting Style: Defense**

Your defenses are as impenetrable as an iron-clad fortress. On your turns where you do not use any of your movement, you can use the Dodge action as a bonus action.

#### Two-Weapon Expertise
**Prequisite Fighting Style: Two-Weapon Fighting**

The speed of your attacks are simply unmatched. You can make two attacks instead of one when you attack with your off hand weapon or make an opportunity attack.

#### Thrown Weapon Mastery
**Prequisite: Thrown-weapon Fighting**

The strength of your weapon toss is staggering. Once per turn when you hit a creature with a ranged attack that you make with a thrown weapon, you can deal the maximum amount of damage possible instead of rolling.

#### Viscious Interception
**Prequisite Fighting Style: Interception**

Your skill when defending others allows you to exact immediate retribution. When you use your reaction to reduce the damage a target takes, you also deal damage to the attacking creature equal to the amount you reduced as a part of the same reaction. The weapon you wield when you make this reaction determines the type of damage the creature takes.
