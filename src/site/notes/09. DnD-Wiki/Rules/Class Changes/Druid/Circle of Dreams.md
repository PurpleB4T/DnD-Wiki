### Circle Spells
*(Added 2nd, 3rd, 5th, 7th, and 9th level feature)*

When you join this circle at 2nd level, your connection to the Feywild grants you access to some spells when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown on the Circle of Dreams Spells table.

Once you gain access to one of these spells, you always have it prepared, and it doesn't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. If you gain access to a spell that doesn't appear on the Druid Spell List, the spell is nonetheless a druid spell for you.

### Walker in Dreams
*(Re-written 14th level feature)*

At 14th level, the magic of the Feywild grants you the ability to travel mentally or physically through dreamlands. When you finish a short rest, you can cast one of the following spells, without expending a spell slot or requiring material components: Dream (with you as the messenger), Scrying, or Teleportation circle.

This use of the teleportation circle spell is special. Rather than opening a portal to a permanent teleportation circle, **you magically mark a surface on which you are standing that your teleportation circle will bring you to anytime you decide to cast it**. Once you teleport to the marked location, the mark vanishes. If the mark isn't on the same plane as you, the spell fails. 

Once you mark a location, you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest. If you mark another location while you already have a mark, the previous mark vanishes.
