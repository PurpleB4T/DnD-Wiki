**Source:** Player's Handbook.

* **Primal Strike:** *Re-Written*
* **Elemental Wild Shape:** *Re-Written*
* **Thousand Forms:** Unchanged

### Circle Forms 
*(Re-written 2nd level feature)*

The rites of your circle grant you the ability to transform into more dangerous animal forms. 

Starting at 2nd level, the max challenge rating of beast you can wild shape into is **double** the number specified in the Max CR column of the Beast Shapes table. You must still abide by the other limitations of Wild Shape. 

For example, at 2nd level you can transform into any beast that has a challenge rating of 1/2 or lower that doesn't have a flying or swimming speed.

Starting at 6th level, you can transform into a beast with a challenge rating as high as your druid level divided by 3, rounded down.

### Greater Wild Shape
*(Replaces 6th level Primal Strike feature)*

Starting at 6th level, your attacks in beast form count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.

Additionally, you can expend both uses of your Wild Shape to transform into a beast with a challenge rating as high as half your druid level (rounded down).

Once you use your Wild Shape this way, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest.

### Elemental Wild Shape
*(Re-written 10th level feature)*

At 10th level, when you use your Greater Wild Shape feature, you can choose to transform into an air, earth, fire, or water elemental instead.

### Thousand Forms
*(Re-written 14th level feature)*

By 14th level, you have learned to use magic to alter your physical form in more subtle ways. You can cast the alter self spell at will and can cast it without providing a verbal component. You can cast the spell this way while in Wild Shape.
