# Main
## Base Class Features

**Source:** Player's Handbook.
* **Natural Shifter:** *Added*

### Natural Shifter
*(Added 12th level feature)*

Starting at 12th level, your connection to nature allows you to effortlessly adopt the forms of its simplest denizens. 

You can transform into a beast of CR 0 at will without expending a use of your Wildshape feature for as long as you can maintain concentration (as if you were concentrating on a spell). All the other rules for Wildshape still apply.
