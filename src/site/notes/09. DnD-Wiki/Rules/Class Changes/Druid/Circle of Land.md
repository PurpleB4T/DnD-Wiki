### Environment Attunment
*(Re-written 2nd level "Circle Spells" feature)*

At 2nd level, you are infused with the ability to cast certain spells based on your environment. These spells are listed in the Environment Spells table. When you finish a long rest, you can attune to one of the following options based on the environment around: arctic, cave, coast, desert, forest, grassland, mountain, or swamp.

While you are attuned to that environment you gain access to the spells in the corresponding column of the Environment Spells table below. They count as druid spells for you and you always have them prepared, but they don't count against the total number of druid spells you can prepare each day.

### Nature's Ward
*(Re-written 10th level feature)*

When you reach 10th level, you are immune to poison and disease. Additionally, when you finish a short or long rest, choose one of the following damage types: acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder. You gain resistance to that type of damage until the end of your next short or long rest.

### Nature's Sanctuary
*(Improved 14th level feature)*

When you reach 14th level, your connection to nature grants allow you to empower your defense with enchanting magic. 

As a bonus action, you can grant yourself a number of **temporary hits points equal to your druid level**. These temporary hit-points carry over to your Wildshape forms. 

If a creature attacks you while you have these temporary hit points, that creature must make a Wisdom saving throw against your druid spell save DC. A creature that can't be charmed automatically succeeds.

On a failed save, the creature must choose a different target, or the attack automatically misses. On a successful save, the creature is immune to this effect for 24 hours. The creature is aware of this effect before it makes its attack against you. 

Once you this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.
