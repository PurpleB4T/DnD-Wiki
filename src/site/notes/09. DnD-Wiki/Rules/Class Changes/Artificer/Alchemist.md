### Tool Proficiency (improved)
*(3rd level feature)*

When you adopt this specialization at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with alchemist's supplies. If you already have this proficiency, you gain proficiency with one other type of artisan's tools of your choice.
**Your knowledge of alchemy gives you a natural affinity for brewing potions. Creating a potion through normal crafting takes you only half the time and cost it would normally take.**

### Alchemical Reagent's Pouch (Added)
*(3rd level feature)*

At 3rd  level, you've acquired a pouch of useful basic reagents, much as a wizard might carry a component pouch. You've tucked away things that will come in handy, and can retrieve them as part of using an ability that might require them. As long as you have this pouch on, you can do alchemy. This pouch is considered as alchemy supplies for the purposes of crafting.
If you lose your reagent pouch, you can spend 50 gold pieces to reacquire the various stocks you need, or spend 1 full day gathering them from a natural environment without expense.

### Instant Reactions (Added)
*(3rd level feature)*

At 3rd level, you know how to get instant reactions to occur without the niceties of grinding, simmering and brewing required for more refined concoctions.
Moreover, you know enough ways to do this that with just a few standard supplies, you can get these results out of a wide range of things you can gather in almost any locale and a pinch from your reagent pouch.
You know the following instant reactions.
#### Alchemical Fire. 
As an action you can produce a reaction causing a searing flame. At a point within 15 feet, you can toss a quick combination of things that will cause searing fire to flare up in a 5 foot radius. Creatures in that area have to make a dexterity saving throw, or take 1d8 fire damage.
The damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th level (2d8), 11th level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8).
#### Poisonous Gas. 
As an action you can produce a reaction causing noxious fumes. At a point within 15 feet, you can toss a quick combination of things that will cause a whiff of poisonous gas to erupt spreading to a radius of 5 feet. Creatures in that area have to make a constitution saving throw, or take 1d4 poison damage and become poisoned until the end of their next turn.
The damage increases by 1d4 when you reach 5th level (2d4), 11th level (3d4), and 17th level (4d4).
#### Healing Draught. 
As a bonus action, you can produce a combination that will provide potent magical healing. Immediately after creating the draught, you can use your action to consume it or give it a creature within 5 feet. An adjacent creature can use their reaction to drink it if given it. If an adjacent creature is incapacitated and unconscious, you can use your action to feed it to them. A creature who drinks this draught regains 1d8 health. A creature can benefit from a number of these healing draughts equal to their constitution modifier (minimum 1), after which they provide no additional benefit until they complete a long rest.
The healing increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th level (2d8), 11th level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8).

### Alchemist Spells (Unchanged)
*(3rd level feature)*

Starting at 3rd level, you always have certain spells prepared after you reach particular levels in this class, as shown in the Alchemist Spells table. These spells count as artificer spells for you, but they don’t count against the number of artificer spells you prepare.

| Artificer Level | Alchemist Spells |
| - | - |
| 3rd | Healing Word, Ray of Sickness |
| 5th | Flaming Sphere, Melf's Acid Arrow |
| 9th | Gaseous Form, Mass Healing Word |
| 13th | Blight, Death Ward |
| 17th | Cloudkill, Raise Dead |



### Alchemical Infusions (Replaces Experimental Elixir)
*(3rd level feature)*

At 3rd level, you have found a way to skip most of the brewing process for alchemically creating potent magical effects by directly infusing the potion with your own magic. Creating a potion using this feature takes you an hour. You have to have an empty vial available.

You may choose one of the following spells and can use a spell slot to cast it, or team up with another spellcaster and turn one of their spells into a potion.

Spell Level |Infusion Spells
 --- | ---
1st | cure wounds, entangle, grease
2nd |barkskin, shatter, lesser restoration
3rd |blink, water breathing
4th |stoneskin, confusion
5th |cloudkill, skill empowerment

When you cast the spell in this way, the spell does not take effect immediately, but is infused into the potion. If the spell grants an effect or restores health, the creature will gain the effect of the spell when the potion is consumed.



#### Team Potions.
You can team up with other spellcasters to create potions of spells not listed in the previous table. The following rules apply for this:

* You can easily bottle a spell of a level up to your highest spell level. Infusing a potion with a higher level spell than available requires a successful check using the Alchemists tools of 20 + the levels above
*eg. bottling Haste (as a 3rd level spell) at an 8th level Alchemist requires a check of 21*
* Spells can only be cast at base level.
* Extra modifiers of spellcaster do not apply.
* Cast spells have to target only one creature or an area. *So Scorching Ray is not applicable while Witch Bolt or Fireball are.*
* Hitting an enemy creature with an attack-roll based spell in the potion still requires a normal attack against its AC. The DC for a saving throw is the Alchemists DC. While the attack roll is handled as throwing the potion (meaning a Dexterity based attack )
* Any material components need to be used in creation (specific materials are consumed; spells with specific material components, that can't be ignored using a focus and are not consumed aren't applicable)
* Moving spells like Spiritual Weapon or Flaming Sphere are not applicable.
* The potion doesn't lose its effect or potency after a specific time, but lasts until consumed.
* Affecting a willing creature: The person throwing the potion must make a Dex-Check for a DC of 10 + cover mod (half cover/3quarter cover) (+ 2 for difficult terrain)

If the spell has an area of effect, that area of effect takes place when the vial is broken, with the effect centered on where the vial breaks. As an action, you or another creature can either consume the vial, or throw it up to 30 feet where it shatters on impact.

You can create a number of potions up to half your PB (rounded down), each day.

### Empowered Alchemy (Replaces Alchemical Savant)
*(5th level feature)*

Starting at 5th level, when you deal damage or restore health with an instant reaction or alchemical infusion, you can add your intelligence modifier to the damage dealt or health restored.

### Restorative Reagents (Unchanged)
*(9th level feature)*

Starting at 9th level, you can incorporate restorative reagents into some of your works:

- Whenever a creature **drinks an alchemical infusion** you created, the creature gains temporary hit points equal to 2d6 + your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1 temporary hit point).
- You can cast Lesser Restoration without expending a spell slot and without preparing the spell, provided you use alchemist's supplies as the spellcasting focus. You can do so a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.
 

### Chemical Mastery (Unchanged)
By 15th level, you have been exposed to so many chemicals that they pose little risk to you, and you can use them to quickly end certain ailments:

- You gain resistance to acid damage and poison damage, and you are now immune to the poisoned condition.
- You can cast Greater Restoration and Heal without expending a spell slot, without preparing the spell, and without providing the material component, provided you use alchemist’s supplies as the spellcasting focus. Once you cast either spell with this feature, you can't cast that spell with it again until you finish a long rest.

\pagebreak
### Added Infusions:
A few Infusion are added for Alchemists. They count against the number of your known infusions.
#### Aroma Therapies.
You expand your alchemical knowledge to be able to produce incense and simmering reagents that grant effects to those that inhale their fumes. If creatures spend a long rest inhaling fumes from a concoction you devise with this feature, creatures regain all of their expended hit dice, instead of only recovering half, and are cured of any non-magical diseases they are suffering from.


#### Adrenaline Serum. 
**Prerequisite: 9th level Artificer.**

You create a potent serum. As a bonus action on your turn, you can consume this serum, granting you the effects of Haste and Heroism for a number of rounds equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum 1). These effects do not require concentration, but you still suffer the normal effects of the Haste spell ending when it ends. You can use this a number of times equal to your constitution modifier (minimum 1) before you must take a long rest to gain the effects from the serum again.
Another creature can take this dose, but they must pass a Constitution saving throw equal to your spell save to gain the effects, and become poisoned on a failed save.
 
#### Delivery Mechanism.
You modify the stability of your reagents and develop a better delivery mechanism. You can target a point within 30 feet for your instant reactions that target a point. The additional precision allows you to better target the effects, allowing creatures of your choice within the target area to automatically pass their dexterity saving throw against your effects.

#### Explosive Reaction.
You formulate a new instant reaction, a devastating minor explosion. Targeting a point within 15 feet, you cause an explosion. Creatures within 10 feet of the target point must make a constitution saving throw, or take 1d10 thunder damage from the shockwave of the explosion.
The damage increases by 1d10 when you reach 5th level (4d10), 11th level (4d10), and 17th level (4d10).

#### Greater Adrenaline Shot. 
**Prerequisite: Adrenaline Serum.**

You upgrade your adrenaline shot to produce even more extreme and magical effects in the creature it affects. The adrenaline shot also adds the effect of Tenser's Transformation when you consume it. This effect only takes place if you are the one consuming the serum. You do not suffer the effects of Tenser's Transformation wearing off when the serum effect ends.
Inoculations.
You and up to five allies of your choice are inoculated against the poisonous effects you can produce that require a constitution saving throw (such as the poisonous gas instant reaction or the cloudkill infusion). Additionally, you gain resistance to poison damage.

#### Infusion Stone. 
**Prerequisite: 9th level Artificer.**

You use the secrets of Alchemy to create an Infusion Stone. You can use this stone in the process of infusing potions in place of a spell slot of equal or higher level than the highest level spell slot you can cast.
You can use this stone to replace a spell slot for an infusion once. It regains this charge after you complete a long rest.

#### Mana Potion.
During a short rest, you can create a mana potion. A mana potion loses its potency if it is not consumed within 1 minute. As an action, a creature can consume a mana potion to restore a spell slot of its choice, up to third level.



#### Poisoner's Proficiency. 
You delve into the secrets of the darkest secrets of herblore, learning the potent secrets of poison. During a long rest, you can create one of the following poisons. You can also nullify a poisons effect with a successfull check using your tools.
##### Contact poison. 
You can apply this to a weapon or up to ten pieces of ammunition, lasting until the end of your next long rest. That weapon deals an additional 1d4 poison damage to targets it strikes.
##### Ingested poison. 
This is a simple flavorless powder. If a creature consumes a full dose of this poison before the end of your next long rest, after one minute has passed they must make a Constitution saving throw with disadvantage against your spell save DC or take a number of d10 equal to your Artificer level in poison damage, and become poisoned until they complete a long rest.

#### Secrets of Enhancement.
You learn the secrets of infusing powerful enhancements into your Alchemical Infusions. You can add the following spells to your list of available spells for alchemical infusions:

Spell Level | Infusion Spells
---|---
1st |heroism
2nd |enlarge/reduce
3rd |haste
