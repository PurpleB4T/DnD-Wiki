[[09. DnD-Wiki/Rules/Class Changes/Warlock/Warlock\|Back to Warlock]]
*(Improved Eldritch Invocation)*

You can cast  Mage Armor on yourself at will, without expending a spell slot or material components.

**Alternatively**, whenever you finish a short rest, you can touch one suit of armor or shield that you are proficient with to bind it to you. This binding lasts until you use this feature again.

As a bonus action you can instantly don or doff this armor or shield, magically summoning it onto your person or dismissing it into an extradimensional space.
