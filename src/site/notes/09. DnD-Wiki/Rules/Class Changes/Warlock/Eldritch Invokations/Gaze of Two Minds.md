*(Improved Eldritch Invocation)*

You can use your action to touch a willing humanoid and **create a mental bond** with them which lasts as long as the creature is on the same plane of existence as you or until you use this feature on another humanoid. 

While this link is active you can use a bonus action to perceive through its senses **until you end it as a bonus action**. While perceiving through the other creature's senses, you benefit from any special senses possessed by that creature, and you are blinded and deafened to your own surroundings.
