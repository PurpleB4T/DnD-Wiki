*(Added Eldritch Invocation)*

**Prerequisite: 9th level, Pact of the Talisman feature.**

When you finish a short or long rest you can choose a damage type from one of the following: acid, fire, cold, lighting, thunder, poison, radiant, necrotic or psychic. 

The wearer of your talisman gains resistance to that damage type until you choose a different one with this feature.
