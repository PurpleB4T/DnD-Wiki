[[09. DnD-Wiki/Rules/Class Changes/Warlock/Warlock\|Back to Warlock]]

**You have made your pact with a mysterious entity from the Shadowfell – a force that manifests in sentient magic weapons carved from the stuff of shadow. The mighty sword Blackrazor is the most notable of these weapons, which have been spread across the multiverse over the ages. The shadowy force behind these weapons can offer power to warlocks who form pacts with it. Many hexblade warlocks create weapons that emulate those formed in the Shadowfell. Others forgo such arms, content to weave the dark magic of that plane into their spellcasting.**

**Because the Raven Queen is known to have forged the first of these weapons, many sages speculate that she and the force are one and that the weapons, along with hexblade warlocks, are tools she uses to manipulate events on the Material Plane to her inscrutable ends.**

### Hexblade's Curse
*(Re-written 1st level feature)*

Starting at 1st level, you gain the ability to place a baleful curse on someone. 

As a bonus action, choose one creature you can see within 30 feet of you. The target is cursed for 1 minute. The curse ends early if the target dies, you die, or you are incapacitated. Until the curse ends, you gain the following benefits:

* You gain a bonus to damage rolls against the cursed target. The bonus equals your proficiency bonus.
* Any attack roll you make against the cursed target is a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20 on the d20.
* If the cursed target dies, you regain hit points equal to **twice your proficiency bonus**.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your **proficiency bonus**, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a **long rest.**


```ad-note 
title: Optional Revision: The Hexer
collapse: no

The Hexblade subclass was originally introduced as a solution to the problems that Pact of the Blade Warlocks would commonly experience. However, this quick fix solution resulted in The Hexblade becoming the only viable option for Bladelocks and unintentionally created a powerful multi-classing dip by introducing the benefits of the "Hex Warrior" feature as early as 1st level when it could have been an amendment to the "Pact of the Blade" feature instead.

If you consider this to be a problem in your own game, you can remove the "Hex Warrior" feature and rename the subclass to "The Hexer" or "The Cursed One" (while also renaming "Hexblade's Curse" to "Curse of The Hexer" or "Mark of the Cursed One"). This way, you can prevent single level multi-classing dips into Hexblade and the subclass is no longer conformed to the identity of a cursed weapon wielder and can instead be any kind of Warlock that specializes in curses. Additionally, you can choose to add the extended spell list from hexblade to the Warlock spell list for any kind of bladelock.
```

### Hex Warrior
At 1st level, you acquire the training necessary to effectively arm yourself for battle. You gain proficiency with medium armor, shields, and martial weapons.

The influence of your patron also allows you to mystically channel your will through a particular weapon. Whenever you finish a long rest, you can touch one weapon that you are proficient with and that lacks the two-handed property. When you attack with that weapon, you can use your Charisma modifier, instead of Strength or Dexterity, for the attack and damage rolls. This benefit lasts until you finish a long rest. If you later gain the Pact of the Blade feature, this benefit extends to every pact weapon you conjure with that feature, no matter the weapon's type.

### Accursed Specter
Starting at 6th level, you can curse the soul of a person you slay, temporarily binding it in your service. When you slay a humanoid, you can cause its spirit to rise from its corpse as a specter. When the specter appears, it gains temporary hit points equal to half your warlock level. Roll initiative for the specter, which has its own turns. It obeys your verbal commands, and it gains a special bonus to its attack rolls equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of +0).

The specter remains in your service until the end of your next long rest, at which point it vanishes to the afterlife.

Once you bind a specter with this feature, you can't use the feature again until you finish a long rest.

### Armor of Hexes
At 10th level, your hex grows more powerful. If the target cursed by your Hexblade’s Curse hits you with an attack roll, you can use your reaction to roll a d6. On a 4 or higher, the attack instead misses you, regardless of its roll.

### Master of Hexes
Starting at 14th level, you can spread your Hexblade's Curse from a slain creature to another creature. When the creature cursed by your Hexblade's Curse dies, you can apply the curse to a different creature you can see within 30 feet of you, provided you aren't incapacitated. When you apply the curse in this way, you don't regain hit points from the death of the previously cursed creature.
