title: Eldritch Invocations as Pact Boon Features
collapse: no

 Pact Boons are reliant on at least one associated Eldritch Invocation to be considered viable. Consider removing the following invocations in order to make them free additions to their adjacent Pact Boon Features:
* **Thisting Blade**
* **Investment of the Chain Master**
* **Rebuke of the Talisman**
* **Book of Ancient Secrets**
```

### Pact of the Blade
*(Re-written 3rd level feature)*

You gain **proficiency** in martial weapons, medium armor and shields.

Additionally, you can use your action to create a pact weapon in your empty hand, which can be any melee weapon of your choice. This pact weapon has the following properties:

* You are proficient with this weapon while you wield it and **you can use your Charisma modifier, instead of Strength or Dexterity, for the attack and damage rolls**.
* This weapon counts as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to non-magical attacks and damage.
* When you reach 5th level in this class, **you can attack with your pact weapon twice**, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.
* Your pact weapon disappears if it is more than 5 feet away from you for 1 minute or more. It also disappears if you use this feature again, if you dismiss the weapon (no action required), or if you die.

Alternatively, you can transform one magic weapon into your pact weapon by performing a special ritual while you hold the weapon. You perform the ritual over the course of 1 hour, which can be done during a short rest. You can then dismiss the weapon, shunting it into an extradimensional space, and it appears whenever you create your pact weapon thereafter. You can't affect an artifact or a sentient weapon in this way. The weapon ceases being your pact weapon if you die, if you perform the 1-hour ritual on a different weapon, or if you use a 1-hour ritual to break your bond to it. The weapon appears at your feet if it is in the extradimensional space when the bond breaks.

### Pact of the Chain
*(Re-written 3rd level feature)*

You learn the Find Familiar spell and can cast it as a ritual. The spell doesn't count against your number of spells known. When you cast the spell, you can choose one of the normal forms for your familiar or one of the following special forms: imp, pseudodragon, quasit, or sprite. 

The summoned familiar is infused with a measure of your eldritch power, granting the creature the following benefits:
* The familiar gains either a flying speed or a swimming speed (your choice) of **40 feet**.
* As a **bonus action**, you can command the familiar to take the Attack action. You can also sacrifice
one of your attacks when you take the Attack action to command the familiar to **make one attack instead.**
* The familiar’s weapon attacks are considered **magical** for the purpose of overcoming immunity and resistance to non-magical attacks.
* If the familiar forces a creature to make a saving throw, it uses your **spell save DC.**
* When the familiar takes damage, you can use your reaction to grant it **resistance against that damage.**


### Pact of the Talisman
*(Re-written 3rd level feature)*

Your patron gives you an amulet, a talisman that can aid the wearer when the need is great. When a creature wears the amulet they gain the following benefits:
* **They gain a +1 bonus to their AC.**
* Whenever they fail an ability check, **they can add a d4 to the roll**.
* When they are hit by an attacker you can see within 30 feet of you, you can use your reaction to deal psychic damage to the attacker equal to **1d4 + your Charisma Modifier** and push it up to 10 feet away from the talisman's wearer.


If you lose the talisman, you can perform a 1-hour ceremony to receive a replacement from your patron. This ceremony can be performed during a short or long rest, and it destroys the previous amulet. The talisman turns to ash when you die.


### Pact of the Tome
*(Re-written 3rd level feature)*

Your patron gives you a grimoire called a Book of Shadows. When you gain this feature, choose three cantrips from any class's spell list. While the book is on your person, you can cast those cantrips at will. They are considered warlock spells for you, and they needn't be from the same spell list. They don't count against your number of cantrips known.

Additionally, **you can inscribe magical rituals in your Book of Shadows**. Choose two 1st-level spells that have the ritual tag from any class's spell list; these rituals needn’t be from the same spell list. The spells appear in the book and don't count against the number of spells you know. With your Book of Shadows in hand, you can cast the chosen spells but only as rituals, unless you've learned them by some other means. You can also cast a warlock spell you know as a ritual if it has the ritual tag.

On your adventures, **you can add other ritual spells to your Book of Shadows**. When you find such a spell, you can add it to the book if the spell's level is equal to or less than half your warlock level (rounded up) and if you can spare the time to transcribe the spell. For each level of the spell, the transcription process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp for the rare inks needed to inscribe it.

If you lose your Book of Shadows, you can perform a 1-hour ceremony to receive a replacement from your patron. This ceremony can be performed during a short or long rest, and it destroys the previous book. The book turns to ash when you die.
