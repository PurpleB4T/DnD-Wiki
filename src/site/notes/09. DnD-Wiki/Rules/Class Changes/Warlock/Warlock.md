## Base Class Features
* **Pact Magic:** *Improved*
* **Eldritch Master:** *Re-written*
**Armor:** Light armor  
**Weapons:** Simple weapons  
**Tools:** None  
**Saving Throws:** Wisdom, Charisma  
**Skills:** Choose two from Arcana, Deception, History, Intimidation, Investigation, Nature, and Religion

### Equipment
You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:

- (a) a light crossbow and 20 bolts or (b) any simple weapon
- (a) a component pouch or (b) an arcane focus
- (a) a scholar's pack or (b) a dungeoneer's pack
- Leather armor, any simple weapon, and two daggers

### Pact Magic
Your arcane research and the magic bestowed on you by your patron have given you facility with spells.

#### Cantrips
**You know the Eldritch Blast Cantrip,** which doesn't count against the number of Warlock cantrips you know. 

You also know two cantrips of your choice from the warlock spell list. You learn additional warlock cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Warlock table.

#### Spell Slots
The Warlock table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your warlock spells of 1st through 5th level. The table also shows what the level of those slots is; all of your spell slots are the same level. To cast one of your warlock spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a spell slot. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a short or long rest.

For example, when you are 5th level, you have two 3rd-level spell slots. To cast the 1st-level spell witch bolt, you must spend one of those slots, and you cast it as a 3rd-level spell.

##### Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher
At 1st level, you know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the warlock spell list.

The Spells Known column of the Warlock table shows when you learn more warlock spells of your choice of 1st level or higher. A spell you choose must be of a level no higher than what's shown in the table's Slot Level column for your level. When you reach 6th level, for example, you learn a new warlock spell, which can be 1st, 2nd, or 3rd level.

Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the warlock spells you know and replace it with another spell from the warlock spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

##### Spellcasting Ability
Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your warlock spells, so you use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a warlock spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

**Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier

**Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier

```ad-note 
title: Optional Rule: Int, Wis or Cha Warlocks
collapse: no


A number of players have stated a desire to explore Warlock as a knowledge seeker rather than a cultish demagogue. So as an optional rule for the sake of players who wish to explore the idea of an Intelligence based Warlock, consider using the optional feature below to expand on the Warlock's roleplaying versatility.
 
 This rule also determines a variant for the minimum ability score necessary to multi-class into Warlock by allowing a player to choose between a minimum of 13 Charisma, or 13 Intelligence.
```

##### Spellcasting Focus
You can use an arcane focus as a spellcasting focus for your warlock spells.

### Eldritch Invocations
*(Optional 2nd level feature)*

In your study of occult lore, you have unearthed eldritch invocations, fragments of forbidden knowledge that imbue you with an abiding magical ability.

At 2nd level, you gain two eldritch invocations of your choice, **one minor and one major**. When you gain certain warlock levels, you gain additional invocations of your choice, **beginning with an additional minor invocation at 5th level and then a major invocation at 7th level and so on**.

Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the invocations you know and replace it with another invocation that you could learn at that level.

If an eldritch invocation has prerequisites, you must meet them to learn it. You can learn the invocation at the same time that you meet its prerequisites. A level prerequisite refers to your level in this class

```ad-note 
title: Optional Rule: Major and Minor Invocations
collapse: no

Since invocations aren't always geared towards optimizing the Warlock as a combatant, Players might find themselves under or over-performing depending on their choices. As a possible rule to try and counteract this problem, you could use this optional rule to strike an even balance between the weaker more flavor focused minor invocations and the stronger more combat enhancing major invocations.
```

### Ability Score Improvement
When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

### Eldritch Versatility (Optional)
Whenever you reach a level in this class that grants the Ability Score Improvement feature, you can do one of the following, representing a change of focus in your occult studies:

- Replace one cantrip you learned from this class's Pact Magic feature with another cantrip from the warlock spell list.
- Replace the option you chose for the Pact Boon feature with one of that feature's other options.
- If you're 12th level or higher, replace one spell from your Mystic Arcanum feature with another warlock spell of the same level.

If this change makes you ineligible for any of your Eldritch Invocations, you must also replace them now, choosing invocations for which you qualify.

### Mystic Arcanum
At 11th level, your patron bestows upon you a magical secret called an arcanum. Choose one 6th-level spell from the warlock spell list as this arcanum.

You can cast your arcanum spell once without expending a spell slot. You must finish a long rest before you can do so again.

At higher levels, you gain more warlock spells of your choice that can be cast in this way: one 7th-level spell at 13th level, one 8th-level spell at 15th level, and one 9th-level spell at 17th level. You regain all uses of your Mystic Arcanum when you finish a long rest.

### Path of Occult Discovery
*(Optional 1st level feature)*

Starting at 1st level, you must determine what path allowed you to happen upon the otherworldly patron with which you formed your pact. Some Warlocks earn the attention of these otherworldly beings through bargaining and their beguiling demeanor, while others discover their patrons by scouring through tomes of esoteric lore. Choose one of the following when you select this class:

- **Occult Negotiator.** Your charismatic nature has allowed you reap the benefits of your pact. Charisma is your ability modifier for this class's spells and features.
- **Occult Investigator.**  Your diligent studies have taught you how to tap into the power granted to you by your patron. **Intelligence is your ability modifier for this class's spells and features.**

### Eldritch Master
*(Re-written 20th level feature)*

At 20th level, you can draw on your inner reserve of mystical power while entreating your patron to regain expended spell slots. 

As a **bonus action**, you can entreat your patron for aid to regain all your expended spell slots from your Pact Magic feature.

Once you regain spell slots this way, you must finish a long rest before you can do so again.
