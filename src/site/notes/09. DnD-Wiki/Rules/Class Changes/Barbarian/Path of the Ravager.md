*(Rewritten "Path of the Battlerager")*

* **Battlerager Armor:** *Replaced*
* **Reckless Abandon:** *Re-written*
* **Battlerager Charge:** *Replaced*
* **Spiked Retribution:** *Replaced*


### Spiked Armor Training 
*(Replaces 3rd level "Battlerager Armor" feature)*

When you choose this path at 3rd level, your training allows you to utilize your armor into a weapon.

You gain proficiency in **smith's tools** in addition to spiked armor, a **variant set of light or medium armor** covered in spikes, barbs or similar features.

You can modify a set of medium or light armor into spiked armor during a long rest using smith’s tools. If the armor is magical, then the damage from your spiked armor becomes magical. 

The spiked variant of a set of armor weighs 5 pounds more and has the following traits when worn with proficiency: 

* **Armor Spikes.** Your unarmed strikes deal piercing damage equal to 1d6 + your Strength modifier on a hit. If you aren't wielding any weapons or a shield when you make the attack roll, the d6 becomes a d8.
* **Retribution.** At the start of each of your turns, you deal 1d4 piercing damage to one creature that has you grappled or is grappled by you.
* **Climbing Hooks.** You have a climbing speed of 30 feet as the armor spikes allow you to hook into vertical surfaces.


### Reckless Abandon
*(Re-written 6th level feature)*

Beginning at 6th level, when you use Reckless Attack while raging, you also gain temporary hit points equal to **half your Barbarian level (rounded up)**. They vanish if any of them are left when your rage ends.


### Barbed Charge
*(Replaces 10th level "Battlerager Charge" feature)*

At 10th level, you have learned how to capitalize on your momentum. While you are raging and aren’t wearing heavy armor, you can dash as a bonus action. 

Additionally, if you move towards a creature and make an unarmed attack while wearing spiked armor, you deal an additional **1d6 piercing damage** for every 10 feet you spend moving in a straight line towards the target of your attack (up to a maximum of 4d6). 

If you reduce a medium or small creature to 0 hit points with this attack, **it is impaled upon your spikes until the start of your next turn, providing you with cover.** A medium creature grants three quarters cover and a small creature grants half cover.

### Piercing Grasp
*(Replaces 14th level "Spiked Retribution" feature)*

At 14th level, if you are raging and take damage from a creature that is within 5 feet of you, **you can use your reaction to make a melee weapon attack against that creature.** If this attack hits while you are wearing spiked armor and you have an open hand, you can choose to **automatically grapple the creature** by hooking your spikes into it.

Furthermore, **you can add your rage damage bonus** to the damage you deal with the retribution trait from your spiked armor.
