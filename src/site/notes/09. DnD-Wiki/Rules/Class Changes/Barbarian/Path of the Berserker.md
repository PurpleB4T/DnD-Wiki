**[[09. DnD-Wiki/Rules/Class Changes/Barbarian/Barbarian\|Back to Barbarian]]**
**Source:** Player's Handbook.
* **Frenzy:** *Re-Written & Re-located*
* **Mindless Rage:** Unchanged
* **Intimidating Presence:** *Re-written*
* **Retaliation:** *Re-Written & Re-located*

 
 Specifically, with the *Berserker* Subclass, *Battle Frenzy* & *Frenzied Assault* are optional and replace the Frenzy and Retaliation. You can't just replace one of these features, you always have to replace both.
 
 
### Frenzy
*(rewritten 3rd level)*
*(different ruling of Frenzy, you can take either this option and follow the official leveling, or take the combination of "Battle Frenzy" and "Retaliation")*
 
 
You can go into a frenzy when you rage. If you do so, for the duration of your rage you can make a single melee weapon attack as a bonus action on each of your turns after this one. When your rage ends, you suffer one level of exhaustion.
Additionally, you have the ability to push your body beyond its limits. You recover from Exhaustion faster than others, recovering one level of Exhaustion on short rests. You can also survive for longer without food. The amount of days you can go without food is calculated as follows: 

**Number of Days without food:** 3 + your constution modifier + half your proficiency bonus


### Battle Frenzy
*(Re-written relocated 14th level "Retaliation" feature to 3rd level)*

Starting when you choose this path at 3rd level, while you are raging and take damage from a creature that you can see, you can use your reaction to do one of the following:

* Make a melee weapon attack against that creature if it is within reach. 
* Move up to half your speed, moving only towards that creature.

At 14th level, you can use this reaction even while you're not raging. If you are raging when you use this reaction, you can move up to your full movement speed towards the creature that triggered the reaction, instead of half.

### Mindless Rage
*(6th level feature)*

Beginning at 6th level, you can't be charmed or frightened while raging. If you are charmed or frightened when you enter your rage, the effect is suspended for the duration of the rage.

\columnbreak
### Intimidating Presence
*(Reworked 10th level feature)*

Beginning at 10th level, your attacks inflict terror upon your enemies, granting you the following traits:

#### Frightening Strength 

You gain a bonus to Intimidation checks equal to your Strength modifer (minimum of +1).

#### Menacing Blow
**Once per turn when you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack**, you can force it to make a Wisdom saving throw (DC equals 8 + your PB + your Strength modifier) or be Frightened of you until the end of your next turn. Alternatively, you can force a creature to make this saving throw in place of an attack to avoid dealing damage to it.

You can extend the duration of this effect on the frightened creature by using this feature again on it during subsequent turns. The effect ends if the creature ends its turn out of line of sight or more than 60 feet away from you.

If the creature succeeds on its saving throw, you can't use this feature on that creature again for 24 hours.


### Retaliation
*(14th level feature, working with Frenzy)*

Starting at 14th level, when you take damage from a creature that is within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to make a melee weapon attack against that creature.

### Frenzied Assault
*(Re-written and relocated 3rd level "Frenzy" feature moved to 14th level)*

Starting at 14th level, when you take the attack action while you are raging and have advantage on an attack roll against one of the targets, you can forgo the advantage for that roll to make an additional melee weapon attack against that target, as part of the same action. You can do so no more than once per turn.
