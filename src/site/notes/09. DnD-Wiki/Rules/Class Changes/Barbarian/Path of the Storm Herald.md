*  **Storm Soul:** Unchanged

*  **Raging Storm:** *Re-Written*

### Storm Aura
*(Re-written 3rd level feature)*

Starting at 3rd level, you emanate a stormy, magical aura while you rage. The aura extends 10 feet from you in every direction, but not through total cover. 

Your aura has an effect that activates when you enter your rage, and you can activate the effect again on each of your turns as a bonus action. Choose desert, sea, or tundra. Your aura's effect depends on that chosen environment, as detailed below. 

You can change your environment choice whenever you **finish a short or long rest**. If your aura's effects require a saving throw, the DC equals 8 + your PB + your Constitution modifier.

#### Desert
When this effect is activated, **each creature of your choice** within your aura take fire damage equal to **half your barbarian level (rounded up)** at the end of each of your turns.

#### Sea
When this effect is activated, once on each of your turns you can use a bonus action to choose one other creature you can see in your aura and force them to make a Dexterity saving throw. The target takes **2d6** lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The damage increases when you reach certain levels in this class, increasing to **3d6** at 5th level, **4d6** at 10th level, **5d6** at 15th level, and **6d6** at 20th level.



#### Tundra 
When this effect is activated, each creature of your choice in your aura gains a number of temporary hit points equal to **half your barbarian level (rounded up)**, as icy spirits protect it from suffering.


### Power of the Storm
*(Re-written 10th level feature)*

At 10th level, the power of the storm you channel grows mightier, granting you the following benefits while raging:

* Each creature of your choice has the damage resistance you gained from the Storm Soul feature while the creature is in your Storm Aura.

* As a bonus action, you can gain a flying speed equal to your current walking speed until the end of your turn.

### Raging Storm
*(Re-written 14th level feature)*

At 14th level, you have gained mastery over the storm.

As a bonus action, which can be a part of the same bonus action you use to enter your rage, you can choose to become **immune** to the damage type you gained resistance to from your Storm Soul feature for the duration of your rage. Once you do so, you can't become immune to that damage type again until you finish a long rest.

Furthermore, you gain an additional effect based on the environment you chose for your Storm Aura.

#### Scorching Desert

Immediately after a creature in your aura hits you with an attack, you can use your reaction to force that creature to make a Dexterity saving throw against your Aura save DC. On a failed save, the creature is **blinded** until the start of it's next turn as its vision fills with hot sand.

#### Crashing Sea

**Once per turn** when you hit a creature in your aura with an attack, you can force that creature to make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is knocked prone, as if struck by a wave.

#### Freezing Tundra

Whenever you use a bonus action to activate the effect of your Storm Aura, you can choose one creature you can see in the aura. That creature must succeed on a Strength saving throw against your Aura save DC, or it has its speed reduced to 0 **and can not take reactions** until the start of your next turn, as magical frost covers it.
