* (a) two handaxes or (b) any simple weapon
* An explorer's pack and four javelins

### Rage
In battle, you fight with primal ferocity. On your turn, you can enter a rage as a bonus action.

While raging, you gain the following benefits if you aren't wearing heavy armor:

You have advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws.
When you make a melee weapon attack using Strength, you gain a bonus to the damage roll that increases as you gain levels as a barbarian, as shown in the Rage Damage column of the Barbarian table.
You have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.
If you are able to cast spells, you can't cast them or concentrate on them while raging.

Your rage lasts for 1 minute. It ends early if you are knocked unconscious or if your turn ends and you haven't attacked a hostile creature since your last turn or taken damage since then. You can also end your rage on your turn as a bonus action.



Once you have raged the number of times shown for your barbarian level in the Rages column of the Barbarian table, you must finish a long rest before you can rage again.

### Unarmored Defense
While you are not wearing any armor, your armor class equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Constitution modifier. You can use a shield and still gain this benefit.

### Danger Sense
*(2nd level feature)*

At 2nd level, you gain an uncanny sense of when things nearby aren't as they should be, giving you an edge when you dodge away from danger. You have advantage on Dexterity saving throws against effects that you can see, such as traps and spells. To gain this benefit, you can't be blinded, deafened, or incapacitated.

### Reckless Attack
*(2nd level feature)*

Starting at 2nd level, you can throw aside all concern for defense to attack with fierce desperation. When you make your first attack on your turn, you can decide to attack recklessly. Doing so gives you advantage on melee weapon attack rolls using Strength during this turn, but attack rolls against you have advantage until your next turn.

## Features

### Intimidating Strength
*(additional feature for all Barbarians)*

Instead of Rolling using your charisma modifier when attempting to intimidate others, you roll using your strength. Intimidation counts as a strength ability for all Barbarians. 

### Primal Knowledge (Optional)
*(3rd level feature)*

When you reach 3rd level and again at 10th level, you gain proficiency in one skill of your choice from the list of skills available to barbarians at 1st level.

### Ability Score Improvement
When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of yo

### Extra Attack
*(5th level feature)*

Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

### Fast Movement
*(Improved 5th level feature)*

Starting at 5th level, your speed increases by 10 feet and your **jump distance is doubled** while you aren't wearing heavy armor.

\columnbreak 
### Instinctive Pounce (Optional)
*(7th level feature)*

At 7th level, as part of the bonus action you take to enter your rage, you can move up to half your speed.

### Brutal Critical
*(9th level feature)*

Beginning at 9th level, you can roll one additional weapon damage die when determining the extra damage for a critical hit with a melee attack. (Meaning: If your weapons does a total of 2d6, you can roll another 1d6 and add it to the damage)

This increases to two additional dice at 13th level and three additional dice at 17th level.

### Relentless Rage
*(Improved 11th level feature)*

Starting at 11th level, your Rage can keep you fighting despite grievous wounds.

**You ignore the Poisoned condition and the effects of Exhaustion while raging.**

Additionally, if you drop to 0 hit points while you're raging and don't die outright, you can make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. If you succeed, you drop to 1 hit point instead.

Each time you use this feature after the first, the DC increases by 5. When you finish a short or long rest, the DC resets to 10.

### Persistant Rage
*(Improved 15th level feature)*

Beginning at 15th level, your Rage is so fierce that it ends early only if you fall Unconscious or if you choose to end it.

Additionally, **when you fail a saving throw**, you can choose to either spend one use of your rage feature or end your current rage early to re-roll the saving throw and must use the new roll (no action required). You do not spend or end the rage on a failed saving throw.

### Indomitable Might
*(18th level feature)*

Beginning at 18th level, if your total for a Strength check is less than your Strength score, you can use that score in place of the total.

### Primal Champion

At 20th level, you embody the power of the wilds. Your Strength and Constitution scores increase by 4. Your maximum for those scores is now 24.
