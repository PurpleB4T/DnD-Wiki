### Spirit Totem
*(Re-written and Re-arranged progression)*

At 3rd level, when you adopt this path, you choose a totem spirit and gain its feature. You must make or acquire a physical totem object – an amulet or similar adornment – that incorporates fur or feathers, claws, teeth, or bones of the totem animal. At your option, you also gain minor physical attributes that are reminiscent of your totem spirit. For example, if you have a bear totem spirit, you might be unusually hairy and thick-skinned, or if your totem is the eagle, your eyes turn bright yellow.

Your totem animal might be an animal related to those listed here but more appropriate to your homeland. For example, you could choose a hawk or vulture in place of an eagle.


#### Bear 
While you're raging, any creature within 5 feet of you that's hostile to you has disadvantage on attack rolls against targets other than you or another character with this feature. An enemy is immune to this effect if it can't see or hear you or if it can't be frightened. The spirit of the bear makes you a fearsome protector.

#### Elk 
While you're raging and aren't wearing heavy armor, your walking speed increases by 15 feet. Additionally, **you can't be knocked prone** unless you choose to be. The spirit of the elk makes you extraordinarily sure-footed and swift.

#### Tiger
While you're raging, you can use a **bonus action to grapple a target.** While a target is grappled by you, you can use a bonus action on each of your turns to crush it, **dealing bludgeoning damage equal to 1d4 + your strength modifier.** The spirit of the tiger makes you a deadly predator in close quarters.

#### Wolf

Once per turn while raging, when you damage a creature with a melee attack, you can force the target to make a Strength saving throw (DC equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier). On a failed save, **the creature is knocked prone.** The spirit of the wolf gives you the tenacity to force your enemies to the ground.



### Aspect of the Beast
*(Re-written 6th level feature)*

At 6th level, you gain a magical benefit based on the totem animal of your choice. You can choose the same animal you selected at 3rd level or a different one.

#### Elk 
You attain the swift stride of an elk. Whether mounted or on foot, your travel pace is doubled, as is the travel pace of up to ten companions while they're within 60 feet of you and you're not incapacitated. **Additionally, non-magical difficult terrain doesn’t cost any additional movement for you.**

#### Tiger
You attain the deft and agile movements of a tiger. **You gain a climbing speed equal to your walking speed.** Additionally, you can move stealthily while traveling at a normal pace and so can up to ten companions while they're within 60 feet of you and you're not incapacitated (see chapter 8 "Adventuring" for rules on travel pace).

#### Wolf
You attain the hunting sensibilities of a wolf. **You have advantage on Wisdom (Survival) checks to track creatures you have encountered in the past month.** Additionally, you can track other creatures while traveling at a fast pace (see chapter 8 "Adventuring" for rules on travel pace).



### Totemic Attunement
*(Re-written 14th level feature)*

At 14th level, you gain a magical benefit based on a totem animal of your choice. You can choose the same animal you selected previously or a different one.

#### Bear 
*(Re-arranged from 3rd level to 14th level)*

While raging, you have resistance to all damage except psychic.

#### Elk
While raging, **you can move freely through the space of a Large or smaller creature.** Additionally, when you decide to shove a creature, you can **push it up to 10 feet away from you and knock it prone**, dealing bludgeoning damage equal to 1d12 + your Strength modifier.

#### Tiger
While you're raging, if you move at least **10 feet** in a straight line toward a target and hit it with a melee weapon attack, you can use a bonus action to make an additional melee weapon attack against it.

#### Wolf
*(Re-arranged from 3rd level to 14th level)*

While you're raging, any allies within **10 feet** of you have advantage on attack rolls against any creature within 5 feet of you that is hostile to you.
