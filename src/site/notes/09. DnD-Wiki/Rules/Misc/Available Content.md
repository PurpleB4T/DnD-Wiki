**Races/ Lineages.** There is a selection of lineages available, some are homebrew and others are from the official books. Any lineage with a number next to its name has been modified or homebrewed so be sure to look at the noted lineage document. Even if a lineage is mentioned in multiple source books, use the version linked in the table below.
<br>
**Backgrounds.** Any background which isn't setting specific is available. Additionally, you can create a custom background with the DM.
<br>
**Classes.** Any officially published class is allowed. The [[09. DnD-Wiki/Rules/Class Changes/Ranger\|Ranger]] however uses the *Tasha's Cauldron of Everything* variant. The full description of it can be found in this wiki.
Please Check out all the class changes we made in this wiki when creating your character. 

**Feats.** We made changes to several feats. Please make sure to use this wiki instead of Vanilla DnD when choosing features. I will gradually add every feat regardless of if I changed them or not to this wiki. 
<br>
**Spells.** Any officially published spells are available to pick and choose from. Additionaly, over time I will add homebrew spells to the expanded weaponlist as well.

**Expanded Weaponlist.** For more inspiration for your characters weapons you can use this [[09. DnD-Wiki/Rules/Misc/Expanded Weapon List\|Expanded Weapon List]]
