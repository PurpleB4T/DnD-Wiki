[[09. DnD-Wiki/Rules/Misc/Features/Feats\|Back to Feat Overview]]

You have mastered ranged weapons and can make shots that others find impossible. You gain the following benefits:

- Attacking at long range doesn't impose disadvantage on your ranged weapon attack rolls.
- Your ranged weapon attacks ignore half and three-quarters cover.
- Before you make an attack with a ranged weapon that you are proficient with, you can choose to take a penalty to your attack by subtracting your **proficiency bonus** from the total of the roll. If the attack hits, you can add additional damage equal to **twice your proficiency bonus**.
