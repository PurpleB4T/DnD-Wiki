[[09. DnD-Wiki/Rules/Misc/Features/Feats\|Back to Feat Overview]]

Skilled at mimicry and dramatics, you gain the following benefits:

- Increase your Charisma score by 1, to a maximum of 20.
- You gain **proficiency** in disguise kits.
- You have advantage on Charisma (Deception) and Charisma (Performance) checks when trying to pass yourself off as a different person, or **mimic the sounds of another creature**. You must have heard the person speaking, or heard the creature make the sound, for at least 1 minute.
- **You can create a diversion** by making either a Charisma (Deception) check or a Charisma (Performance) check. If you do so, choose a number of targets equal to half your level that can see or hear you. Each target must make a contested Wisdom (Insight) check. If you succeed, a target has **disadvantage** on Wisdom (Peception) checks and initiative rolls for the duration of your diversion and for 1 minute after a target can no longer see or hear you.
