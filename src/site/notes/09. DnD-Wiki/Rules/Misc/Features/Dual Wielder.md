[[09. DnD-Wiki/Rules/Misc/Features/Feats\|Back to Feat Overview]]

You master fighting with two weapons, gaining the following benefits:

- You gain a +1 bonus to AC while you are wielding a separate melee weapon in each hand.
- You can use two-weapon fighting even when the one handed melee weapons you are wielding aren’t light.
- You can draw or stow two one-handed weapons when you would normally be able to draw or stow only one.
- Once per turn when you miss with a weapon attack, you can immediately make **another attack** on the same target with a one-handed melee weapon held in the other hand.
