[[09. DnD-Wiki/Rules/Misc/Features/Feats\|Back to Feat Overview]]

You have martial training that allows you to perform special combat maneuvers. You gain the following benefits.

- You learn two maneuvers of your choice from among those available to the Battle Master archetype in the fighter class. If a maneuver you use requires your target to make a saving throw to resist the maneuver's effects, the saving throw DC equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength or Dexterity modifier (your choice).
- You gainÂ **two superiority die**, which are d6s (these die are added to any superiority dice you have from another source). These die are used to fuel your maneuvers. A superiority die is expended when you use it. You regain your expended superiority die when you finish a short or long rest.
