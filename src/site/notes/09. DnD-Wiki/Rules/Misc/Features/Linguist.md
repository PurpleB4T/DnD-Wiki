[[09. DnD-Wiki/Rules/Misc/Features/Feats\|Back to Feat Overview]]

You have studied languages and codes extensively, granting you the following benefits:

- Increase your Intelligence score by 1, to a maximum of 20.
- You learn how to speak, read and write in three languages of your choice.
- You have **advantage on Wisdom (Insight) checks** to understand the basic meaning of anything vocally communicated by a creature that you can hear or anything physically communicated by a creature you can see, provided that you have spent at least 1 minute observing it.
- You can ably create written ciphers. Others can't decipher a code you create unless you teach them, they succeed on an Intelligence check (DC equal to your Intelligence score + your proficiency bonus), or they use magic to decipher it.
- You have **advantage on Intelligence checks to try and decode ciphers**. If you can not immediately decode a cipher you can spend a day's work to gain a basic understanding of what is written, allowing you to re-roll your attempt to decode it.
