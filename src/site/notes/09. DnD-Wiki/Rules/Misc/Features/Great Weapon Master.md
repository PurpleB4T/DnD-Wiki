[[09. DnD-Wiki/Rules/Misc/Features/Feats\|Back to Feat Overview]]

You’ve learned to put the weight of a weapon to your advantage, letting its momentum empower your strikes. You gain the following benefits:

- On your turn, when you score a critical hit with a melee weapon or reduce a creature to 0 hit points with one, you can make one melee weapon attack as a bonus action.
- Before you make a melee attack with a heavy weapon that you are proficient with, you can choose to take a penalty to your attack by subtracting your **proficiency bonus** from the total of the roll. If the attack hits, you can add additional damage equal to **twice your proficiency bonus**.
