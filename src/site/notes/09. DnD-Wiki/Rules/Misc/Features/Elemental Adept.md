[[09. DnD-Wiki/Rules/Misc/Features/Feats\|Back to Feat Overview]]

**Prerequisite: The ability to cast at least one spell**

When you gain this feat, choose one of the following damage types: acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder.

Spells you cast ignore resistance to damage of the chosen type. An Immunity will become Resistance. In addition, when you roll damage for a spell you cast that deals damage of that type, you can treat any 1 on a damage die as a 2.

You can select this feat multiple times. Each time you do so, you must choose a different damage type.
