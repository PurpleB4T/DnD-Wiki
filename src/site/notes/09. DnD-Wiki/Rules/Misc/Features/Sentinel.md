[[09. DnD-Wiki/Rules/Misc/Features/Feats\|Back to Feat Overview]]

**Prerequisite: Strength 13 or higher**

You have mastered techniques to take advantage of every drop in any enemy's guard, gaining the following benefits:

- Creatures provoke opportunity attacks from you even if they take the Disengage action before leaving your reach.
- When a creature within 5 feet of you makes an attack against a target other than you (and that target doesn't have this feat), you can use your reaction to make a melee weapon attack against the attacking creature.
- When you hit a creature with an opportunity attack and it is no more than one size larger than you, the creature's speed becomes 0 for the rest of the turn.
