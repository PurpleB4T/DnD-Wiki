[[09. DnD-Wiki/Rules/Misc/Features/Feats\|Back to Feat Overview]]

**Prerequisite: Strength 13 or higher**

You've developed the skills necessary to hold your own in close-quarters grappling.
- Increase your Strength score by 1, to a maximum of 20.
- You have advantage on **melee weapon attacks** against a creature you are grappling including attempts to shove or knock it prone.
- **You learn the following grappling maneuvers**:

**Headlock.** As an action you can attempt to suffocate a creature that you are grappling. Make another grappling check contested by the target. On a success the creature is silenced and begins choking (see chapter 8 of the PHB, "The Environment" for rules on suffocation). You must use your action each turn to maintain the grapple this way, inflicting 1d6 bludgeoning damage to the target each time you do so.

**Pin Down.** As an action you can attempt to restrain a creature you are grappling. Make another grappling check contested by the target. On a success the target is Restrained, and your movement is reduced to 0 for the duration of the grapple.
