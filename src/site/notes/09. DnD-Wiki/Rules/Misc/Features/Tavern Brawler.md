- Increase your Strength or Constitution score by 1, to a maximum of 20.
- Your unarmed strike uses a d4 for damage.
- When you hit a creature with an unarmed strike or an improvised weapon on your turn, you can use a bonus action to attempt to grapple the target.
- You are proficient with improvised weapons. **Your improvised weapons use a 1d6 for damage, or 1d8 if they are wielded with two hands.**
- Your improvised weapons can have **any of the following properties** if the DM deems it appropriate: finesse, heavy, light, reach, two-handed, versatile. Anything that weighs less than your carrying capacity and is no more than one size larger than you can be used as an improvised weapon.
