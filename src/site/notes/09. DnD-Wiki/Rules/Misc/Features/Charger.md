[[09. DnD-Wiki/Rules/Misc/Features/Feats\|Back to Feat Overview]]

You can rush through enemies with the force of a raging bull, gaining the following benefits

- Increase your Strength score by 1, to a maximum of 20.
- You can use your **bonus action to Dash**.
- While dashing in a straight line, you can move through the space of any creature as if they were an ally and you have **resistance** to damage caused by opportunity attacks.
- If you move at least 10 feet in a straight line while dashing before entering the space of a creature that is no more than one size larger than you, you can force it to make a strength saving throw (DC equals 8 + your strength + your proficiency bonus) or it is pushed ahead of you for the rest of your movement. Pushing a creature one size larger than you halves your remaining movement. If a creature fails the save by 5 or more, it is also knocked prone.
