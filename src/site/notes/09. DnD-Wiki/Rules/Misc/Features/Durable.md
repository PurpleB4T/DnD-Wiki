[[09. DnD-Wiki/Rules/Misc/Features/Feats\|Back to Feat Overview]]

Hardy and resilient, you gain the following benefits:

- Increase your Constitution score by 1, to a maximum of 20.
- When you roll a Hit Die to regain hit points, the minimum number of hit points you regain from the roll equals twice your Constitution modifier (minimum of 2).
- You have **advantage** on Constitution saving throws to avoid gaining points of exhaustion.
- You have **advantage** on death saving throws. If you would ever suffer instant death, you are instead reduced to 0 hit points with one death saving throw failure.
