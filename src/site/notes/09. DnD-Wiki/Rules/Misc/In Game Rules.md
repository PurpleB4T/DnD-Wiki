**Healing Potions** Healing potions count as using an object, and therefore take up an action. 
<br>
**Critical Hit Variant.** When you roll a nat 20, instead of simply doubling the damage rolled, you maximize the damage possible with your weapon/ spell, and then roll the dice necessary again and add them to the max damage. After all that, add your modifiers. 

*Example:* You attack with a 1d8 sword and roll a nat 20. You then take the max damage possible with your hit die, in this case it would be 8 and then actually roll the die, add the two together and add your mods. Damage die (1d8) + damage max (8) + mods (only once) = critical hit damage.

**Death Saves** The DM rolls Death Saving Throws for you.

**Inspiration Variant**
Everyone starts with one point of inspiration (which they can use themselves or give out to other player). By the end of each session everyone gets to vote which three players get inspiration (which can also stack, as in you can have multiple ones at a time but can only use one on a roll). The DM has final say in the vote, but importantly the awarding of inspiration feature is a team effort. The inspiration can be used after a roll to improve and the higher counts. 

*Inspiration is clearly shown on the token of each character.*

**Flanking Variant.** If players stand on opposite sides of an enemy the get advantages on melee attacks. The reverse applies as well

**Prone.** Standing up from Falling Prone generates Attack of Opportunity

**Called Shots.**
Called shots that target specific body parts to further damage creatures. The targeted body part gets half or three-quarter cover depending on the size of the part. If the body part is hit, the creature must make a Constitution saving throw (agains prof bonus + ability score + 8)

**Masterwork Equipment.**
In 5th edition of Dungeons and Dragons, wondrous equipment is an optional rule, and even when allowed magical weapons and armor tend to lack customization options.
As a callback to older editions, introducing Masterwork equipment adds another way for players to upgrade their equipment and spend their ever-increasing riches.
Masterwork equipment is gear that grants additional properties besides a +1 to Attack or damage. From weighing half as much as they should to granting advantage to a single type of check.

**Fall Damage**
This rule is used to replace the Fall Damage rule of the Basic rules. A Creature falling will take damage according to the following table. Keep in mind, that for every 10ft a creature falls, it takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage. A creature with a flying speed (eg. having wings) will take less damage/ have an easier time reducing the fall damage.
Falling a creature can make an Acrobatics Saving Throw to halve the taken damage.

| Fall Height | Damage | Acrobatics DC |  
| ----------- | ------ | ------------- | 
| 10ft        | 1d6    | 10            |     
| 20ft        | 2d6    | 15            |     
| 30ft        | 3d6    | 20            |     
| 40ft        | 4d6    | 25            |     
| 50ft        | 5d6    | 30            |     
| 60ft        | 6d6    | not possible  |     
| 200ft       | 20d6   | not possible  |  
| 500ft       | 50d6   | not possible  |    

#### Ritual Casting (WIP)
This rule replaces base Ritual Casting. 

- Every full caster can ritual cast
    - They follow the “normal” ritual-casting rules
- Casters with Ritual-Casting Feature can ritual cast spells without the “ritual”-tag
- Ritual Caster Feature becomes an open feature -> no prerequisites, just in-chara justification
- make “Summon Steed” & “Summon Greater Steed” a ritual
- **Open Questions:**
    - Should half-casters be able to ritual cast
    - Which spells are applicable for extended ritual casting (first name that came to mind)

As you can see there is some open questions. 
I hope to extend on this as we play and think about which spells to exclude/ etc.  For the time being, half casters like Paladins, Rangers and specific subclasses are included in these rules and can ritual cast.
