## Chromatic

**Dragonborn with chromatic ancestry claim the raw elemental power of chromatic dragons. The vibrant colors of black, blue, green, red, and white dragons gleam in those dragonborn's scaled skin and in the deadly energy of their breath weapons. Theirs is the raw elemental fury of the volcano, of biting arctic winds, and of raging lightning storms, as well as the subtle whisper of swamp and forest, toxic and corrosive.**

- **Ability Score Increase.** Increase one ability score by 2 and increase a different one by 1, or you increase three different scores by 1.
- **Type.** You are a Humanoid.
- **Size.** You are Medium.
- **Speed.** Your walking speed is 30 feet.
- **Chromatic Ancestry.** You trace your ancestry to a chromatic dragon, granting you a special magical affinity. Choose one type of dragon from the Chromatic Ancestry table. This determines the damage type for your other traits as shown in the table.

|Dragon|Damage Type|
|Black|Acid|

|Red|Fire|

- **Breath Weapon.** When you take the Attack action on your turn, you can replace one of your attacks with an exhalation of magical energy in a 30-foot line that is 5 feet wide. Each creature in that area must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC = 8 + your Constitution modifier + your proficiency bonus). On a failed save, the creature takes 1d10 damage of the type associated with your Chromatic Ancestry. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage. This damage increases by 1d10 when you reach 5th level (2d10), 11th level (3d10), and 17th level (4d10). You can use your Breath Weapon a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.
- **Draconic Resistance.** You have resistance to the damage type associated with your Chromatic Ancestry.
- **Chromatic Warding.** Starting at 5th level, as an action, you can channel your draconic energy to protect yourself. For 1 minute, you become immune to the damage type associated with your Chromatic Ancestry. Once you use this trait, you can’t do so again until you finish a long rest.
- **Languages.** You can speak, read, and write Common and one other language that you and your DM agree is appropriate for the character.

## Metallic

**Dragonborn with metallic ancestry lay claim to the tenacity of metallic dragons — brass, bronze, copper, gold, and silver — whose hues glint in their scales. Theirs is the fire of hearth and forge, the cold of high mountain air, the spark of inspiration, and the scouring touch of acid that purifies.**

- **Ability Score Increase.** Increase one ability score by 2 and increase a different one by 1, or you increase three different scores by 1.
- **Type.** You are a Humanoid.

    - - **Enervating Breath.** Each creature in the cone must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or become incapacitated until the start of your next turn.
        - **Repulsion Breath.** Each creature in the cone must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be pushed 20 feet away from you and be knocked prone.
    - Once you use your Metallic Breath Weapon, you can’t do so again until you finish a long rest.
- **Languages.** You can speak, read, and write Common and one other language that you and your DM agree is appropriate for the character.

## Gem

**Gem dragonborn partake of the heritage of gem dragons, who claim to be heirs of Sardior, the Ruby Dragon. The colors and mysterious powers of gem dragons — amethyst, crystal, emerald, sapphire, and topaz — gleam in these dragonborn’s scaled skin and course through their veins. Theirs are the wonders of the mind, the force of will, the brilliant light of insight, and the resounding echo of discovery — but also the desiccation of despair.**
