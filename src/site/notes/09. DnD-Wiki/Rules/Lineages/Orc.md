**Orcs trace their creation to the one-eyed god Gruumsh, an unstoppable warrior and powerful leader. The divine qualities of Gruumsh resonate within orcs, granting them a reflection of his toughness and tenacity that can’t be matched, and the god equipped his children to be able to live above or below ground.**

**On some worlds, such as Eberron, orcs were among the first defenders of the natural order from the encroachments of Fiends and other extraplanar threats. Gruumsh’s blessings have made orcs tireless guardians and mighty allies wherever they are found, even when they turn their devotion to other gods.**

# Eberron - Rising from the Last War

**Thousands of years before humans came to Khorvaire, the land was dominated by wild ores and goblinoids of the Dhakaani Empire. The goblin empire scattered the ore tribes and forced them into harsh and unwanted lands: the swamps of the Shadow Marches, the Demon Wastes, and the depths of the Ironroot Mountains. But in the Shadow Marches, the ores learned the secrets of druidic magic from the dragon Vvaraak, becoming the first of the Gatekeepers. With the invasion of the alien daelkyr from Xoriat, the Gatekeepers put the dragon's teaching to the test, creating magical seals that bound the daelkyr in the depths of Khyber and protected Eberron against further incursion from the plane of madness.**

# Explorer's Guide to Wildemount

**Orcs are one of Exandria's youngest races, and are said to have been born from elves seared by the blood of Gruumsh, the Ruiner, when Corellon pierced the orc god's eye on the field of battle. For long years, orcs were feared as mindless abominations, drawn to slaughter like moths to flame.**

**Stories tell of how the blood of the Ruiner flows in the veins of all orcs, driving them to commit acts of terrible violence and anger. Orcs call this fury hgar'Gruum, or the curse of ruin, and use it to refer to everything from battle rage to a bad temper. Half-orcs are said to have inherited the blood of the Ruiner, and to carry the same bloodlust and fury that orcs do.**

**Orcs and half-orcs do feel a certain pull toward violence and anger. But the simple truth is that there is no curse of ruin. No supernatural power drives orcs to kill. Rather, they are simply victims of the same selfish, violent impulses that corrupt all mortal beings.**

# Plane Shift - Ixalan

**Orcs originally came from the same mountainous region where the kingdom of Torrezon was born, and they have been enemies of the Legion of Dusk since it was originally formed. The entire race has been declared anathema by the Church of Torrezon, and after centuries of fighting the Legion, the orcs have dwindled to only a few hundred in number. Some still live on remote islands near Torrezon, but many have joined the Brazen Coalition to serve on pirate ships — taking on any role that calls for an abundance of sheer muscle.**

**Orcs are tall, standing head and shoulders above most humans, and are generally twice as broad. They often accentuate their bulging muscles by wearing tight-fitting bands and accessories around the thickest parts of their arms and necks. Their skin color ranges from light brown through gray to almost jet-black.**
