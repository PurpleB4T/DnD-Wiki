**Ability Score Increase.** Your Charisma Score increases by 2 and one Score of choice by 1.
**Age.** Merfolk reach maturity around age 40 and can live up to 400 years. 
**Size.** Merfolk have human length torsos with long tails that are about three times as long as the torso, not including the caudal fin. Female merfolk are between 9 and 12 feet with their tails and male merfolk are between 7 and 9 feet. Your size is large; when you are in your "leg form", your size is medium. 
**Speed.** Your walking speed is 25 feet when you have legs. Your base swimming speed when you have a tail is 35 feet. 
**Darkvision.** You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.
Emissary of the Sea. Aquatic beasts have an extraordinary affinity with your people. You can communicate simple ideas with beasts that can breathe water. They can understand the meaning of your words, though you have no special ability to understand them in return.
**Beings of the Depths**. Adapted to even the most extreme ocean depths, you have resistance to cold damage.
**Languages.** Primordial, common
**Amphibious.** You can breathe both air and water 
**Transform.** You can turn your hip fins into legs which grant you the ability to walk on land. While transformed, your tail retreats. You can expend one bonus action to transform. 
**Song of the Depths.** Merfolk are exceptional singers, both submerged in water and out in the air. Their unique voices catch the attention of many. You gain an advantage at performance checks when it comes to singing.
