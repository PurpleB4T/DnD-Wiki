**The comforts of home are the goals of most halflings' lives: a place to settle in peace and quiet, far from marauding monsters and clashing armies. Others form nomadic bands that travel constantly, lured by the open road and the wide horizon to discover the wonders of new lands and peoples. Halflings work readily with others, and they are loyal to their friends, whether halfling or otherwise. They can display remarkable ferocity when their friends, families, or communities are threatened.**

- **Age.** A halfling reaches adulthood at the age of 20 and generally lives into the middle of his or her second century.

## Lightfoot
**As a lightfoot halfling, you can easily hide from notice, even using other people as cover. You're inclined to be affable and get along well with others. In the Forgotten Realms, lightfoot halflings have spread the farthest and thus are the most common variety.**

**Lightfoots are more prone to wanderlust than other halflings, and often dwell alongside other races or take up a nomadic life. In the world of Grayhawk, these halflings are called hairfeet or tallfellows.**

- **Ability Score Increase.** Your Charisma score increases by 1.
- **Naturally Stealthy.** You can attempt to hide even when you are only obscured by a creature that is at least one size larger than you.

## Stout
**As a stout halfling, you're hardier than average and have some resistance to poison. Some say that stouts have dwarven blood. In the Forgotten Realms, these halflings are called stronghearts, and they're most common in the south.**

- **Ability Score Increase.** Your Constitution score increases by 1.
- **Stout Resilience.** You have advantage on saving throws against poison, and you have resistance to poison damage.

## Ghostwise
**Ghostwise halflings trace their ancestry back to a war among halfling tribes that sent their ancestors into flight from Luiren. Ghostwise halflings are the rarest of the hin, found only in the Chondalwood and a few other isolated forests, clustered in tight-knit clans.**

**Many ghostwise clans select a natural landmark as the center of their territory, and members carry a piece of that landmark with them at all times. Clan warriors known as nightgliders bond with and ride giant owls as mounts.**

**Because these folk are clannish and mistrustful of outsiders, ghostwise halfling adventurers are rare. Ask your DM if you can play a member of this subrace, which has the halfling traits in the Player's Handbook, plus the subrace traits below.**

- **Ability Score Increase.** Your Wisdom score increases by 1.
- **Silent Speech.** You can speak telepathically to any creature within 30 feet of you. The creature understands you only if the two of you share a language. You can speak telepathically in this way to one creature at a time.

## Lotusden
**Long tied to the natural heart of the Lotusden Greenwood, these halflings have adapted to live synergistically with the chaotic laws of the wilds.**

- **Ability Score Increase.** Your Wisdom score increases by 1.
- **Children of the Woods.** You know the [Druidcraft](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:druidcraft) Cantrip.
