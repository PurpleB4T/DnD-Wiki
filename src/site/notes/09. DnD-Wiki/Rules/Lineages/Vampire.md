- **Ability Score increase.** Your Intelligence and Charisma Scores both increase by 2.
- **Age.** Vampires don’t mature and age in the same way that other races do. Alignment. Vampires have no innate tendency toward evil but consuming the life energy of other creatures often pushes them to that end.
- **Size.** You retain the size of the creature you were before you were turned.
- **Speed.** Your walking speed is 35 feet. 
- **Darkvision.** You have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray. 
- **Vampiric Resistance.** You have resistance to necrotic damage.
- **Languages.** You can speak, write and read Common and the language your character spoke before being turned. 
- **Blood Tracker.** Your kind have minds hard-wired to sense the weak and wounded. You have advantage on all Wisdom (Survival) checks made to track any creature whose current hit points are below their maximum hit points.
- **Blood Thirst.** You can drain blood and life energy from a willing creature, or one that is grappled by you, incapacitated, or restrained. Make a melee attack against the target. If you hit, you deal 1 piercing damage and 1d6 necrotic damage. The target’s hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the necrotic damage taken, and you regain hit points equal to that amount. The reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. 
   The target dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0. A humanoid killed in this way has a 5% chance of tuning into an undead. This undead creature is neutral to you and not in servitude to you. 
   You must consume at least 4 Hit Points worth of blood every two days. If you don’t consume an adequate amount of blood, you gain a level of exhaustion. 

Exhaustion Level | Time | Effects | Blood needed 
-- | -- | -- | -- 
1 | 3rd day without blood | Disadvantage on Ability Checks | 4 HP 
2 | 4th	| Speed halved	| 6 HP
3 | 5th | Disadvantage on attack rolls and saving throws | 8 HP
4 | 6th	| Hit Point Maximum Halved | 10 HP
5 | 7th	| Speed reduced to 0 | 12 HP
6 | 8th	| Death	| 14 HP

If you drink 2 HP worth of blood, you can set your exhaustion back a level till your next long rest. 
If you reach Exhaustion Level 6, make a constitution saving throw. If you succeed, you gain another hour to live, if you fail, you die instantly. You get three chances at this, with increasing DC. On your first attempt, you have to succeed against a DC of 10, on second, against 15 and on the last against 20.
