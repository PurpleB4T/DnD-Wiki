3rd-level transmutation

**Casting Time:** 1 action
**Range:** Self (10 foot Radius)
**Components:** V, S, M (a drop of Water)
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You invoke the Defensive Power of the Tides. Tendrils of Water erupt from you and batter all creatures within 10 feet of you. Your armour class increases by 2.

At the start of its turn a creature in that area must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, a target takes 1d4 bludgeoning damage, is pushed back 10 feet and can’t take reactions until its next turn. On a successful save, the creature takes half damage.
