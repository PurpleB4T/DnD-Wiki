2nd-level conjuration

**Casting Time:** 1 action
**Range:** 60 ft
**Components:** V, S
**Duration:** up to 10 min

You create icy plattforms spanning the spells range. The plattforms are made of ice and can hold up to 500 pounds. Each of them has a DC of 18 with 5 HP.

The steps are transfixed to the point place during the casting and cannot be moved afterwards. When the spell ends or a plattform is destroyed, they shatter and everything on them falls.
