1st-level conjuration

**Casting time:** 1 action
**Range:** 60ft; 15ft radius
**Components:** V,S,M (a shard of glass)
**Duration:** up to 1 minute

Shards of glass and sharp mineral cover the ground in a 15-ft radius circle centered on a point within range. A creature can move at full speed through the terrain, but they will take 1 point of piercing damage for every square (5ft) they move for the duration of the spell. Damage can be avoided by stepping carefully through the shards; meaning half-movement.

Casting this spell at a higher level will increase the radius of the effected area by 5 ft.
