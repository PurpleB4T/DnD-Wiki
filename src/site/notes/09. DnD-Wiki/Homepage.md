# Hello ðŸ¦„
This is my own Wiki for my campaigns, characters and lore. If you find spelling or formatting mistakes, let me know! 
Below is my homebrew overview for your convenience. 
If you want to know more about my campaign world, head over to the [[09. DnD-Wiki/Lore Wiki/Lore Wiki Homepage\|Lore Wiki]].
Over time, this will become the main landing point for anything to do with my games. 
**THIS ENTIRE PAGE IS VERY MUCH A MASSIVE WIP ATM, SO EXPECT A LOT OF CHANGES.**
# Homebrew Overview
If this is your first time playing with me, please be careful to read through this entire section. 
When picking your lineage/ race and class please use this site instead of books or other sources! If a subclass is not in this document you can use vanilla DnD as a source.
## Part 1 - General Character Creation
### Important
The *Nature Domain Cleric* is the only published subclass I won't allow within my game, simply because it treads to far into the Druid's role.
