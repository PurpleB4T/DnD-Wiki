# Introduction
Hello~!
This is the Lore-Wiki, in which I publish commonly known lore/ facts or people of my homebrew D&D world! 
**Disclaimer:** 
Not all the lore you will find in here will be completely factual, as this represents what is known by people within the world. If you want to play a specific race/ know more about a specific topic always approach me :D, so we can work out what/ how much you know!
