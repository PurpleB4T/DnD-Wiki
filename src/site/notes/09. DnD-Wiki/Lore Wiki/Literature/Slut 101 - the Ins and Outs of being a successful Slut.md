# Slut 101 - the Ins and Outs of being a successful Slut **by** `VIEW[{holder}][link]`
- the book was published in the year 1859 under an anonymous author tile by a publisher in Eranvale mostly known for publishing rather daring romance novels 
## Book summary
- the book is supposedly a self help book detailing the steps to become and maintain being a "successful slut"
- it speaks about ethical issues, shame and religious issues
- ways to "maximise profits", which does not refer to selling sexual services but instead about how to gain the most from experiences (be the gains pleasure or goods or money)
- dealing with complex emotions, how to tell if your actions are healthy or not 
	- this chapter also deals with the complex emotions of trauma and responses to it
- long term relationships and how to harmonise your existence as a slut with commitment
	- commitment issues and trust issues
	- difficult feelings such as romantic ones
	- communication is key
	- prioritising what is most important to the individual slut 
- random chapter about the political implications of marriage as an institution and the religious oppression of sluts written in a wildly different style
- the last chapter deals with various "techniques of pleasure"
## Style
- the book is written in a very personal way, instead of a more neutral one typical of "self help books"
- while personal details are omitted, any mentions of experiences come off as personal, it has an almost diary like quality
- wild style shifts suggest multiple authors or at least ghost writers
- dirty language and cuss words are featured in abundance (eg. "when a dickhead wants to shame you for who or what you stick up various holes of yours...")
- the last chapter features crude but detailed sketches of the various techniques
	- writing style wise this chapter is also very crude
## Reception
- not very popular
- some people have theorised that the work must have been written by a/ multiple satry/s
