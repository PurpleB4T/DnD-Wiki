# *A guide to the Flora of the Eranvale* **by**  [[09. DnD-Wiki/Lore Wiki/NPCs/Gwinwydd Cyfnos\|Gwinwydd Cyfnos]]
**Genre:** Science & Technology
The book was originally published in Sylvan in the year 1799, got an elven translation and eventually was also translated into common and is distributed all across Eranvale. 
While the author is listed as [[09. DnD-Wiki/Lore Wiki/NPCs/Gwinwydd Cyfnos\|Gwinwydd Cyfnos]], the book makes clear it was penned by various Druids of the [[09. DnD-Wiki/Lore Wiki/Species/Satyrs#Circle of the tired Dads\|Circle of the tired Dads]] and is based on information the circle collected over many years. 
The book makes clear the consent of Dryads to print and distribute the book on paper. 
Editions published from the year 1816 onwards feature a foreword by Gwinwydd dedicated to his family.  
## Book summary
The book details the various plants which can be found in all mirror planes of the Eranvale area. 

The book begins with introduction chapters for various methods of caring for plants, such as water needs, soil quality, fertilisers and their effect on the plant and how to best communicate with plants. 
The book is categorised by function and commonality of the various plants, in the index in the back one can find plants by various categories.

## Reception
The initial Sylvan release mostly went unnoticed on the material plane due to the language barrier. 
Within the feywild the book saw relative success with various elven settlements within the plane and soon became of interest for [[1. Eranvale Campaign/Major NPCs/Dragon Family/Gize\|Professor Olaynore]]  who at the time still worked for the [[1. Eranvale Campaign/Organisations/University of Entodiff\|University of Entodiff]]. 
A team of botanists from a small wood elf settlement began working on an Elven translation only a year after it's initial release. The translation began as an unofficial effort but soon they reached out for help and official approval by the Druid Circle.
Soon enough Professor Olaynore joined the translation team after catching wind of the project and having been interested in the book for a while. With her help the translation was completed two year after the original Sylvan release and with official approval Professor Olaynore began translating the book into common. 
The Elven release was distributed both in the Feywild and Material Plane of Eranvale and found great success, which increased demands for a translation into Common. 
In 1803 the book finally saw it's official Common translation being distributed, to great success. 

The book can be found in almost all bigger libraries across Eranvale. Various unofficial translations have cropped up throughout the years.
