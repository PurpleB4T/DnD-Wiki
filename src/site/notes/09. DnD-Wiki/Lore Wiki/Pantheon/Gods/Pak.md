# Pak
They say that deep within the all-encompassing roots of the World Tree, in a hollow between space and time, a deity burrows. How long he has lived there is a mystery perhaps only the World Tree remembers. Once mortal, now eternal, Pak will exist as long as there are people with a message to deliver.
