# Or

## Description
 Or is the Overgod responsible for creating the seeds of life. He is considered by many to be the most powerful of the [[09. DnD-Wiki/Lore Wiki/Pantheon/Efithian Pantheon#Overgods\|Overgods]] in the [[09. DnD-Wiki/Lore Wiki/Pantheon/Efithian Pantheon\|Efithian Pantheon]]. 
 He is also known as "The Genesis" to followers of [[09. DnD-Wiki/Lore Wiki/Pantheon/Gods/Or#Genesis\|Genesis]] or as "Father of Light".
 
## History 
The three Creator Deities laid the foundation of the world, from which all other gods and life sprung 

## Religions
### Genesis
**Symbol:** Cross
The Genesis is a religion which worships the beginning itself, and strives to preserve the original creation.
It is a generally very conservative religion, disliking change.

The most common believers are many unicorn congregations.

#### The Genesis
The Genesis is the name by which followers of Genesis refer to Or.
Depictions of him are strictly forbidden, non-compliance will be strictly punished.

> <center>Holy Symbol</center>
##### Personality
He is seen as kind and forgiving, but strict and terrible when angered. He valued forgiveness, repentance and true justice, strongly disdaining vengeance.  And though forgiving, he was intolerant of those who wilfully committed acts of evil or were unrepentant criminals that made living through dishonest means.  

Forgiveness was given to those who repent for their sins, so they may find eternal peace upon death. 
Justice was served to those unwilling to repent. Natural disasters, plagues and destruction would befall sinners, so that they may face eternal punishment.

#### History 
When Or had created the world itself, the first life he created was the [[09. DnD-Wiki/Lore Wiki/Pantheon/Gods/Or#The Eachthighern\|Eachthighern]], a cloven hoofed being which resembled a lion with a goats head with a single radiant horn growing from it's forehead. The Eachthighern was the protector of the [[09. DnD-Wiki/Lore Wiki/Pantheon/Gods/Or#Forest of Beginnings\|Forest of Beginnings]], from which all life was born. 
And as all children do, each creation would eventually leave the forest, so they may populate the world.

One day, a young human woman would return to the forest, seeking refuge from the wedding night with her newly wed brutish husband. 
The young woman's cries of desperation reach the Eachthighern, who makes his way to the crying woman. Her worldly, youthful beauty enchanted the Eachthighern, who was struck by human feelings. 
At that moment, from the Eachthighern's shadow, a bicorn was born. 
The Eachthighern would approach the young woman, and would lay in her lap, consoling her. The young maiden would tell the Eachthighern of her marriage, upon which he felt great injustice done to her. So he offered her to ride to freedom on his back.
Together, they rode to the centre of the forest.
Once the young maiden would unmount the Eachthighern, he plunged his horn into her abdomen, pinning her against the [[09. DnD-Wiki/Lore Wiki/Pantheon/Gods/Or#Sacred Tree\|Sacred Tree]]. The woman bled out, and the Eachthighern sacrificed his own immortality and purity to grant her eternal freedom. 

From her corpse a unicorn would rise. She took the appearance of a graceful deer with a long, luscious mane. 
Together, the unicorn and the Eachthighern would leave the Forest and turn to the fae wilds, where they would populate the realm with their children, now tainted with temptation and mortal desires. 

#### Beliefs
They exclusively worship The Genesis, as they believe he alone created all aspects of the world. They believe only he is a true Creator God, and that [[09. DnD-Wiki/Lore Wiki/Pantheon/Gods/Ayin\|Ayin]] and [[09. DnD-Wiki/Lore Wiki/Pantheon/Gods/Choshek\|Choshek]] represent evil and sin. 

They disavow hedonism, so worshippers also see [[Sune\|Sune]] as a force of evil and temptation. 

Druids and Rangers are seen as uncivilised heretics. Those who pray to [[09. DnD-Wiki/Lore Wiki/Pantheon/Efithian Pantheon#Dragon Deities\|Dragon Deities]] are seen as devil worshippers, and apostates of the original creation. 

#### The Eachthighern 

>[!infobox]
>![Eachthighern.jpg|250](/img/user/09.%20DnD-Wiki/z-Assests/Eachthighern.jpg)
> <center>The Eachthighern</center>


The Eachthighern is believed to be the first unicorn, taking on the appearance of a lion with cloven hooves, and the face of a goat. 

It was created to be the protector of the [[09. DnD-Wiki/Lore Wiki/Pantheon/Gods/Or#Forest of Beginnings\|Forest of Beginnings]] and all her children. 

He was born with the Forest, and only left her when becoming mortal and tainted. 
In his stead, young unicorns must fulfil their duty to protect once they mature, and venture from their home and guard a forest and all her children. 

##### The Current Eachthighern 
The title Eachthighern is passed down to a devout bishop who must be 500 years and over of age. A new one is elected whenever the previous one dies. 

The Eachthighern is spiritual leader and seen as direct connection to the Genesis. 

He has absolute say in religious matters. 

#### Forest of Beginnings
The Forest of Beginnings is the birthing place of all life itself. She is also referred to as the Womb of Life, in which The Genesis planted his seed. 
She is believed to be located on the continent of Efith. Some have claimed her location to be in the centre, others have claimed her to be within the bounds of the southern most territory, which is regarded much controversy, as the people of said land are believed to be corrupted. 

##### Sacred Tree 
Within the Forest of Beginnings stands the Sacred Tree, right at the centre. 
This tree is believed to be connected to all live, hence it's other name  the Umbilicalis. 

#### The Divine Maiden
>[!infobox]
>![Divine Maiden.jpeg|250](/img/user/09.%20DnD-Wiki/z-Assests/Divine%20Maiden.jpeg)
 > <center>The Divine Maiden</center>

The Divine Maiden once was a mortal woman who was granted eternal freedom by the Eachthighern. 
From her flesh the second unicorn was born. It is believed a part of her is watching over every unicorn and believer in the genesis. 
She is worshipped as a symbol of purity and as a source of guidance in temptation.

> **Time** | Early morning hours of the first moon |

This rite is innately tied to the [[09. DnD-Wiki/Lore Wiki/Pantheon/Gods/Or#Priestesses\|Priestesses]], who are female unicorns which have promised to remain pure and chaste. They take upon the role of cleansing the land and it's people from corruption in this rite.

A young humanoid virginal women is chosen by a bishop or priest to represent the [[09. DnD-Wiki/Lore Wiki/Pantheon/Gods/Or#The Divine Maiden\|Divine Maiden]]. This role is holy and seen as an honour to be called to. 
In the early hours of the morning on the first day of a new moon; the community which is to be cleansed of their sins gathers around the chosen Priestess and the Divine Maiden. While everyone chants, the Divine Maiden is made to expose her bosom and to disrobe.
The Priestess then rams her horn into the Divine Maiden, killing her. The Maiden becomes a protective guardian of the community and the Priestess takes on all sins and choses to excommunicate herself, now made unclean.
The maidens body will be displayed till the next new moon.

- only few humanoids prove themselves to be pure and devoted enough to ascent to the rank of Cleric or Paladin
- they hold an important role within the faith, that of spreading the word amongst other humanoids
###### Warlocks/ Familiars
- familiars are humanoid followers of Genesis who devote their life to worship and choose to enter a pact with a unicorn bishop 
- all familiars have to rid themselves of temptation (rid themselves of their nipples) and to remain chaste
- in some congregations familiars receive a brands on their forehead, symbolising their rank and role within the faith  
- male familiars are expected to prove their physical prowess before entering this sacred relationship (multi-class into Paladin, or choose pact of Blade Warlock)
	- it is possible for male familiars to be allowed to marry when they prove themselves loyal; the wife is chosen by their patron
- female familiars are expected to rid themselves of temptation, by removing both breasts and nipples, which are then burned in a ritual; and to remain pure and abstain from all pleasures of life
##### Societal Hierarchies
It is believed that women brought temptation into the world, and are therefore seen as potentially dangerous if not kept in check. 

Furthermore, it is expected of all believers to follow strict gender-roles, to honour the creation. Women who act and/ or present masculine are punished by community work, whereas feminine men are punished by flogging.
