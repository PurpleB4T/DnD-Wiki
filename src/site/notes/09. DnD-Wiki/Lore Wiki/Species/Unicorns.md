# History
## Tale on the creation of unicorns and unicorn jesus
- the first unicorn was created by Ao/ Genesis and sent to the Inner Planes where it would protect the forest of divine creation
	- it looked a lot more like a goat and deer with a bit of lion mixed in for good measure (no mane)
- one day, after humans were born, a young pure woman ran into the forest distraught by her being married off to a brutish man
- the unicorn found her crying under a tree and fell in love with her purity and youthful beauty
	- when the unicorn was struck by human feelings, from the corruption a bicorn was born
- the unicorn would lay in her lap and console the young woman
- upon learning of her marriage, the unicorn would feel a great injustice. The prospect of her purity being taken away by such a brutish human
- so the unicorn offered her freedom, it would offer her to ride on its back and take her deeper in the forest of divine creation
- once they arrive in the centre, the unicorn plunges its horn into her abdomen, pinning her against the tree (in the centre, find a name lmao)
- the unicorn sacrificed its own immortality and purity to grant her eternal freedom, and from her flesh rose a second unicorn
- the two unicorns would leave the forest and turn to the fae wilds, where they would have children, now tainted by human sin and desires
- the young woman would be known as the divine maiden, and worshipped as the virgin mother of all unicorns 
## Resulting religious rites
- the Divine Maiden is a figure of worship and is seen as a protector of unicorns
- the original unicorn Eachthighern is seen as the divine link to Ao and is of great importance to unicorns (referred as the father)
- there are special priestesses who remain virginal their entire life, representing the divine maiden
	- young humanoid women (who have to be pure and innocent) are sacrificed in religious rituals to purge communities and places of evil by having a priestess plunge their horn into their abdomen
	- once the young maiden is killed, the priestess looses her status as pure as they take on the sin of whatever she purified
