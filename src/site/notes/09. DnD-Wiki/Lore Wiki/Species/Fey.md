Some fey were strongly bound or associated with specific natural locations such as water bodies, landmarks, or other geographical features. These included *dryads*, *nymphs*, *naiads*, *nereids*, *oreads*, and *fossergrim*.

Another group that was easily identified were the *hags*.

One group of fey was confusingly called *sprites*, despite this being a specific name for one of its included members. All "sprites" were small, mostly humanoid fey, that typically displayed some insect-like attributes (such as wings). 

Yet another diverse group of minuscule fey were the gremlins, who descended from goblins transformed by fomorian rituals. They included the [fremlin](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Fremlin "Fremlin"), [galltrit](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Galltrit "Galltrit"), [jermlaine](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Jermlaine "Jermlaine"), [snyad](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Snyad "Snyad"), and the [plainsjan](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Plainsjan "Plainsjan") that inhabited the planet [Anadia](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Anadia "Anadia") in [Realmspace](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Realmspace "Realmspace"). Mites were also considered by some to be members of this group.
