# Description
The Feywild, is a plane of unrestrained emotion, magic and nature. 
- Some parts of the plane are always bathed in twilight while in others the bright suns never set
- plane amplifies emotions and sensations

## Geography
- twisted mirror of the material plane
	- at a smaller scale the two are similar but not identical
- much less "civilisation", therefore less alteration of the landscape on a large scale
	- much "wilder"
	- most people and groups that live there integrate themselves into nature and build in harmony with it (eg. satyrs and goblins)
		- usually only feywild dwelling elves build large cities and alter the landscape to their liking 
		- while Eladrin also build cities within the feywild, theirs are a lot more in harmony with their surroundings (often building with nature in mind, in open collaboration with local wildlife and nymphs)
- amplified terrain in minecraft as a great descriptor of how the feywild works
	- forests are much denser, trees are taller and more varied 
	- rivers flow faster, the water is clearer, in some spots is nice and warm and in others its fresh and even freezing, seemingly at random
	- mountains are higher and steeper, cliffs are deeper 
	-
