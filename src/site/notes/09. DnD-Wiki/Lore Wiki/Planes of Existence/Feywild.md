# Description
The Feywild, is a plane of unrestrained emotion, magic and nature. 
- Some parts of the plane are always bathed in twilight while in others the bright suns never set
- similar, some parts are always warm, other always cold, both light and weather are dictated by the magic and emotions of whoever lives there
	- for instance, for many satyrs a mild summer or late spring is ideal, so within satyr territory the day night cycle, weather and season mostly reflect their preferences
- plane amplifies emotions and sensations
- constantly shifting, almost impossible to plot down for non natives
- 

## Geography
- twisted mirror of the material plane
	- at a smaller scale the two are similar but not identical
- much less "civilisation", therefore less alteration of the landscape on a large scale
	- much "wilder"
	- most people and groups that live there integrate themselves into nature and build in harmony with it (eg. satyrs and goblins)
		- usually only feywild dwelling elves build large cities and alter the landscape to their liking 
		- while Eladrin also build cities within the feywild, theirs are a lot more in harmony with their surroundings (often building with nature in mind, in open collaboration with local wildlife and nymphs)
- many archfey build elaborate castles and gardens for their own amusement
- amplified terrain in minecraft as a great descriptor of how the feywild works
	- forests are much denser, trees are taller and more varied 
	- rivers flow faster, the water is clearer, in some spots is nice and warm and in others its fresh and even freezing, seemingly at random
	- mountains are higher and steeper, cliffs are deeper 
### Flow of Time 
- time is wild and unpredictable when it isn't perceived, it is largely subjective
- close to large hubs of civilisation, the flow of time is regular, as more people are aware of it at all times
	- typically, within the territory of satyrs, goblins and large elven and eladrin cities time flows like it would in the material plane
- time flows wild within the spans between settlements or large groups of sentient creatures
	- when traversing those parts, it is required to bring a way to tell the time and to keep track of it
	- if not, the flow of time will become erratic and it will be very hard to return to a "normal" flow unless one enters a "safe zone"
- when time is not perceived, it might stop flowing altogether, so a lone traveller might never wake up when they fall asleep
### Navigation 
- navigating the feywild can be incredibly confusing for those unfamiliar with the plane
- while compasses seemingly work, due to the ever shifting nature of the feywild always north may not lead to the same place as it did before, making traditional means of navigating almost impossible
	- maps however are still useful, as they can create an idea in the traveller's head even if they have never been to their destination, making finding it much easier
- emotional state affects both distance and difficulty of a journey throughout the feywild
	- usually, it is advised to remain calm and optimistic when traversing the feywild 
	- when one fears or dreads the place they are going to, the journey will be longer and harder, they will encounter more danger 
	- conversely a place the traveller is looking forward to their destination will travel safely and quick 
- emotional links will also help with travel, if a person has memories associated with a place, person or object it is easier for them to travel to 
	- when searching a person it can be helpful to hold an object previously owned by them (like a item of clothing, lock of hair, book written or read many times by them, etc.)
	- the more clear or recent memories a person has of their destination, the easier it is for them to reach it
- additionally, the more information is known the easier it is to navigate to a place 
- **when you loose track of your travel companions (like not looking at them for long enough, being in different emotional states, etc.) you might end up in very different parts of the world!**
- *to natives, travel is mostly innate and easy*
### Flora and Fauna
- the plants of the feywild are not too much different from those of the material plane, when looking closely however, differences can be spotted
	- colour, smell and taste are more intense
	- plants grow denser and more verdant 
	- many plants also have mind altering effects on non-fey when ingested 
- there are also many plants which grow only within the feywild
	- many will only ever grow and be cultivated within the plane or close to fae passings 
	- these plants usually have unusual properties, like scales for bark, metal or gemstones growing out of them, glowing leaves, etc. 
	- one of those plants is the rare [[02. Homerules/Drugs/Lysium\|Dyonisos' Vitis]], a pink unassuming lily-like flower with intense mind altering effects
		- this flower is usually cultivated by [[1. Eranvale Campaign/Lore Bits/Species/Dragons/Faerie Dragons\|Faerie Dragons]] and brewed into teas 
		- to non fey, the flower is poisonous and kills within the first few hours after ingestion
		- luckily, the flower is very rare to a point where it is almost impossible to ever find one and the faerie dragon tribes which cultivate it are very possessive 
- animals are also similar, and most animals which inhabit the material plane can also be found in the plane of fey
	- strangely enough, animals with horns (or antlers) and cloven hooves are very rare, and mostly found close to Faerie Gates
- the feywild also has unique animals, notably blink dogs and yeth hounds
- the feywild features more megafauna than the material plane, so mammoths, giant armadillos, aurochs and giant sloths that were driven to near extinction are still common in the feywild  
- domesticated beats are uncommon in the feywild
	- while fey do ride beats and use them for hunting, these are not domesticated and are either caught or offer their services voluntarily 
## Faerie Gates/ Fey passings
- refer to places where travellers might pass from the material plane to the feywild and vice versa
- some gates are always open, usually maintained by whoever uses them to pass, but most only open during very specific circumstances
	- during an equinox the separation of the material plane and the feywild is at it's weakest
- gates don't always have to be a physical object, eg. 
	- a young girl dreams of monsters under her bed on nights of the full moon, during her dream, by climbing under her bed you will find yourself passing to the feywild 
- gates are typically spawning in places which are already abundant with wild magic, such as large mostly untouched forests or caves full of spirits 
- the gate might be completely invisible, but the feywild's energy leaking through often causes physical signs to appear such as rings of mushrooms, springs which flow with healing or harming waters, glowing fungi with magical effects or whirlpools in bodies of water
- travelling through a gate can be literal, as all someone has to do is pass through physically, while others require one to sleep in its proximity, or imagine passing through
- many fey will naturally be able to identify faerie gates and how to pass through them 
- there is magic items which can be used to detect faerie gates 
- **in some places, the fey and material worlds are so close as to be indistinguishable**
	- these areas are usually untouched by civilisation and can be found deep within cave systems, forest, high up on mountains or down in abysses. 
	- within these areas, fey and non fey can interact seamlessly
	- the permanent mixing of the planes usually results in an unpredictable flow of time and magic and making navigation rather hard
	- these areas usually covered in mist 
## Effects on travellers
- travellers are subjected to powerful wild magic of that plane and might permanently be changed
	- for those who stay a long time or dwell near a faerie gate may begin to tap into that magic, and become a sorcerer or druid 
- colours seem less colourful in the material plane once you return, similarly, food may taste bland and joyless once you tasted feywild food
	- these effects are usually only temporary and usually last longer the more time you spent in the feywild or how often you ate their food 
- similarly, non natives or those who are familiar with its magic casting magic within the plane of faerie or close to a gate might find their magic to become unpredictable
- it is not uncommon to slowly have memories of the feywild fade and to become dreamlike unless the person is incredibly strongwilled (this does not affect natives)
- as mentioned previously, time flow is subjective, and when those who travel through the plane loose track of time, they might stop aging, age faster or slower
## Architecture
- most fey primarily use wood in their buildings
	- the woodtypes used are very similar to those of the material plane
- another common building material is stone, which varies depending on where it was collected
- architecture styles are varied and plentyful 
	- for instance, a satyr clan may primarily live in simple but colourful wooden huts, tents and natural caves while an elven city uses the typical elaborate styles most elven cultures are known for
